    \caption{Example of pages from two different pages and embedding between them. We useed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to visualize the distance matrix between all of the pages in a 2-d plain. The clusters presented here are from an Etherium wallet pages with a few variations of the landing page (triangle) and pages that decend from an open-source phishing kit discussed in Seciton-\ref{sec:results} (square)}
