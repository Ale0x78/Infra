    \caption{Example of pages from two different pages and embedding between them. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to visualize the distance matrix between all pages in a 2-D plane. The clusters presented here are from Ethereum wallet pages with a few variations of the landing page (${\color{customorange}\blacktriangle}$) and pages that descend from an open-source phishing kit discussed in Section-\ref {sec:results} (${\color{customblue}\mdblksquare}$). We should note that while the pages have different logos on the right-hand side, the bottom left corner still reads "Google" on those pages.}
