\section{Methodology (1 page)}

This paper aims to study the evolution of browser API usage in phishing pages and leverage execution traces of these pages to identify which ones share an underlying kit. To accomplish this, we require browser API execution trances from phishing pages over a long period and a subset of pages where we know the underlying phishing kit. In the following section, we describe the experimental setup for gathering this data, the steps we took to aggregate and enrich the execution traces, how we identified anomalies and trends, and finally, the steps we took for clustering the data and evaluating them as an analog for phishing kits. 


\subsection{Data Gathering}
\input{figures/infra}
\myparagraph{URL feeds} We gathered phishing pages from a diverse set of phishing feeds, monitoring OpenPhish\cite{openphish}, PhishTank\cite{phishtank}, URLScan\cite{urlscan}, SMS Gateways\cite{nahapetyan2024sms}, PhishDB\cite{phishingDB}, and APWG\cite{apwg}, based on the availability of the feed and the level access we had at the time. Every hour, we checked these feeds for new urls (limited to the last 48 hours) and submitted them into two different crawlers: VisibleV8 and KitPhished.

\myparagraph{VisibleV8} To get execution traces for every script loaded when visiting the page, we used an automated chromium-based crawler with VisibleV8 patches applied. The browser is being automated to visit the page and take screenshots with puppeteer\cite{pptr}, an NPM package by Google to help in UI/UX testing and browser automation. The patched chromium crawler uses puppeteer-stealth, a set of configurations to help mask the headless chrome and puppeteer itself from detection tools\cite{puppeteerstealth}. We initiated the crawls from a university network designated for research purposes and used Catapult\cite{catapult}, a man-in-the-middle proxy, to capture the entire HTTP archive for replayability. The crawler stays on the page for 45 seconds before taking a screenshot to allow scripts to load and start executing; this is consistent with prior work\todocite{Jordan and OpenWPM}.

\myparagraph{KitPhisher} While not guaranteed, some malicious actors leave the zip files of the kits used in a discoverable folder on the same server that hosts the website (for example, the Apache document root). KitPhisher\cite{kitphishr} is a go-based URL fuzzer that attempts to identify any left-over zip files on the server. Prior work\todocite{DynaPhish, Oest's paper} establishes it as an excellent way to collect and analyze phishing kits. If it is successful, it will download the zip file and make a note of the domain from which kitphishr acquired it.

\myparagraph{Brand's Original page} OpenPhish and APWG's eCrime Exchange report the brand that a phishing page targets. We selected 46 out of the top 100 brands targeted and collected VisisbleV8 logs for their home pages and, when applicable, their login pages. This is to assess how similar phishing pages are to their target pages. Prior work by \todocite{WolfInSheep} identified that phishing pages could effectively use browser fingerprints to bypass multi-factor authentication, and \todocite{RwLB} found that phishing pages deploy a plethora of 3rd party fingerprinting scripts. 

\subsection{Data enrichment}
\subsubsection{Enriching browser API executions}
\DraftToDo{The browser (blink?) exposes some web functionality to the v8 engine through javascript objects, function calls, and properties. The spect of these functionalities is mapped out in a webIDL file, hense we called these APIs, WebIDL apis or just IDL APIs for sure. }
\myparagraph{API sets} VisibleV8 comes with a default set of log-postprocessors. These programs take the raw lags generated by the patched Chromium browser and convert it into an organized database, identifying duplicate scripts via sha3 hash, clearly marking the origin of each script that loaded and isolating which javascript API calls are browser API calls via the WebIDL file\footnote{\url{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebIDL}} generated during the while building the patched chromium. For our analysis, we use a tuple of the original page's URL, the script's URL, and a set (unordered) of APIs executed by this script.

\myparagraph{First party API sets} To cut through the noise of cloaked pages and include third-party scripts like Google Analytics, known to be present in phishing pages\cite{phishingvLegit}, we isolate API sets executed by first-party scripts (from now on called first-party API sets). To do this, we establish the root domain as the domain submitted to the feeds and the origin as the domain from which the script is loaded. We consider a script first-party only if loaded from the domain we acquired from our feeds (root domain). 

\myparagraph{Browser APIs of interest} Even focusing on APIs that WebIDL marks, the total number of browser APIs exceeds 15,000. We average Mozila Developer's network ~150 WebAPIs categories when aggregating all the APIs used. However, we also look at prior work by Su \etal{} and Zhang\etal{} for categories of Browser APIs for fingerprinting and general cloaking, respectively. We add onto Crawlphish's table of cloaking categories a new category, Advance fingerprinting, which includes all fingerprinting APIs by the Su \etal{}; we use MDN's documentation to identify a list of 24 APIs that trigger a permission pop-up or validate permission. We should note that while \textit{Permissions.query} is the only way to verify permissions, different WebAPIs like USB, clipboard, Geolocation, and Notification have their different APIs for requesting the pop-up

\subsubsection{Cleaning up KitPhisher output}
\myparagraph{De-duplicating kit files} We crawl the urls with KitPhishr to establish a ground truth dataset with urls originating from the same kit. For \numberencryptedKits{} zip files extracted via kitphishr that have password-based encryption enabled, we use the SHA256 hash of the zip files to which domains yielded the same kit. For the remaining \numberKits{}, we further de-duplicate them into Kit-Families by looking at them as a set of SHA256 of source files\footnote{Sourcefiles identified via libmagic}; if the Jaccard index(Figure~\ref{fig:ji})-based similarity of these sets is equal or greater than 95\% we consider the two kits to be from the same family, and thus group all domains from both kits into the same group. This results in \numberKitFamilies{} kits from \numberofGTDomains{} with an average of \numberofGTDomainperKit{} domains per kit ($\sigma{}=\numberofGTDomainperKitSTD{}$)

\subsection{Identifying trends }
\myparagraph{Identifying anomalies} For anomaly detection, we use rapture\cite{ruptures} to detect change-points in the time series of API calls. We use a linearly penalized segmentation algorithm (PELT), which combines a penalty parameter $\beta$ and a cost function to quickly partition a time series based on points where it detects the series starts to change. For the cost function, we use \textbf{L1Cost}, which uses a deviation in the mean, and for the penalty parameter, we use $\beta=2 \ln{(n)=12}$ where $n$ is the number of days in the timeseries. This aligns with the recommendation of Killick\etal{} in the paper introducing PELT to minimize the Bayesian information criterion. We normalize by our daily URLs ingested and look at a time series of the percentage of daily URLs that executed the given URL. To clear up the results from rapture, we look at the change in the mean between segments. Any chance being less than 1\%, we ignore and merge with the prior segment. 

\myparagraph{Identifying different traces from the same script} VisibleV8 will de-duplicate the same script loaded by multiple pages via the sha3 hash of the script. To establish if scripts have non-deterministic behavior, we pull the set of APIs executed by the script and compare the set of APIs executed by the same script on different pages. We use the Jaccard index to establish the similarity between the sets of APIs.

\subsection{Identifying kits}

We hypothesize that similarity in browser API execution means that the pages originate from the same phishing kit. We use the Jaccard index on the API sets that first-party scripts execute to establish this similarity. We use HDBScan, with a minimum cluster size of 10, to cluster the pages based on the Jaccard index. We then use the ground truth labels from KitPhisher to evaluate the clustering. When ground truth is available, we evaluate the clustering using the Fowlkes-Mallows Index (geometric mean between precision and recall)\cite{fowlkes1983method} and V-measure.

V-measure is a harmonic mean between completeness (all members in a cluster are from the right class) and homogeneity (all members in a cluster are from the same class). V-measure allows tuning a ratio $\beta$ that prioritizes the score towards one vs the other. More importantly, looking at completeness and homogeneity scores lets you see how your clustering approach is getting things wrong\cite{Rosenberg2007VMeasureAC}.
We use sklearn's measure module to calculate all cluster evaluation metrics.\cite{scikit-learn}.

For the much larger set of pages for which we do not have kit labels, we use silhouette score\footnote{While this metric is biased against non-convex clusters, based on our results, we do not see it necessary to switch to a density-specific cluster metric}, a metric relative to how well packed and separated the clusters are, to evaluate the clustering when we do not have ground truth. As this would require clustering a total of more than 700,000 pages, we instead cluster a rolling window of 4 weeks, that we slide by 2 weeks. We then merge these temporal clusters if two clusters from different timezones have at least five common pages (same as our minimum parameter for HDBSCAN).
