\DraftToDo{Browser APIs let you view the ecosystem through a higher level of abstraction. Cloaking techniques, Kits, or sophistication}

We crawl five different phishing feeds for over 300 days to answer the following research questions.
\begin{questions}
    \item How are browser APIs being used in phishing? \label{itm:Q1}
    \item Over time, how does the usage of APIs change in phishing pages? Do phishing pages adopt emerging and experimental browser APIs? \label{itm:Q2}
    \item How indicative is a page's browser API trace of the underlying kit? What differences do we see between the kits? What are the common APIs of pages from the same kit? \label{itm:Q3}
\end{questions}
