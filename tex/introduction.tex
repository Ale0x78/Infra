\BradSays{What is the overarching "Who cares" of the paper}
\DraftToDo{Browser APIs let you view the ecosystem through a higher level of abstraction. Cloaking techniques, Kits, or sophistication. We use browser API to assess browser API usage in phishing pages by measuring before-known techniques and identifying new ones; then, we propose metrics for identifying changes in browser API usage and manually examine the changes highlighted. Finally, we use browser API set usage as a form of identifying similarity between pages, assessing how closely these similarities map to underlying phishing kits}

We crawl five different phishing feeds for over 300 days to answer the following research questions.
\begin{questions}
    \item How are browser APIs being used in phishing? \label{itm:Q1}
    \item Over time, how does the usage of APIs change in phishing pages? Do phishing pages adopt emerging and experimental browser APIs? \label{itm:Q2}
    \item How indicative is a page's browser API trace of the underlying kit? What differences do we see between the kits? What are the common APIs of pages from the same kit? \label{itm:Q3}
\end{questions}
