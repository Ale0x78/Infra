\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We crawl 5 different phishing feeds for over 300 days to answer the following research questions
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the overall patterns in Browser API usage in phishing? What APIs are emerging? How do they compare back to the original page they are trying to imitate?
    \item What parts of the phishing behavior, cloaking, mimicking, and data exfiltration are accomplished using Javascript? What are the browser APIs that facilitate these actions? How do they change over time? 
    \item How valuable are browser API usage information in identifying phishing kits, or related phishing pages
\end{itemize}
