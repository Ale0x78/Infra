We crawl 5 different phishing feeds for over 300 days to answer the following research queustions
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the overall patterns in Browser API usage in phishing? What APIs are emerging? How do they compare back to the original page they are trying to immitate.
    \item What parts of the phishing behavior, cloaking, mimicing, and data exfiltration are accomplished using Javascript? What are the browser APIs that faciliate these actions? How do they change over time? 
    \item How useful are browser API usage information in identifying phishing kits, or related phishing pages
\end{itemize}
