\section{Ethical consideration}
\label{sec:ethics}
This research relied on publicly and commercially available URLs detected using proprietary methods to be phishing websites. No additional threat intelligence is attached to the URLs we are planning to release, and to ensure that any confidential information is not accidentally leaked through the URLs (like GET parameters that are indications of a test submission before the URL was submitted to the feeds), we will blind the get parameters of the urls we visited upon release. 

We did not collect or store any identifiable information about the individuals behind phishing kits or the pages, and we did not conduct any live testing of their networks, as we only visited every page once every 2 weeks.
