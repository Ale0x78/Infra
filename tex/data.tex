\subsection{Phishing Kits and Ground truth}
We collected \totalZipFiles{} archive files from \totalPhishingDomains{} number of domains. Only two were encrypted, which we treated as unique kits based on their SHA256 hash. We further filtered the archive files bu ensuring that they container at least a single code file as identified by Magika. This further reduced our archive count to XXXX.
For the final step of filtering, we removed any kit to domain mappings if a domain mapped to multiple archives to remove confusion when multiple kits were deployed on the same domain.
From these \totalNumberOfKits{} we group these into \totalNumberOfKitFamilies{} based on SHA256 of code files. We noted that most kits, had a rather extreme
