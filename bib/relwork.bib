Despite numerous previous efforts, similarity-based detection methods do not offer sufficient protection for the trusted websites, in particular against unseen phishing pages. This paper contributes VisualPhishNet, a new similarity-based phishing detection framework, based on a triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). VisualPhishNet learns profiles for websites in order to detect phishing websites by a similarity metric that can generalize to pages with new visual appearances. We furthermore present VisualPhish, the largest dataset to date that facilitates visual phishing detection in an ecologically valid manner. We show that our method outperforms previous visual similarity phishing detection approaches by a large margin while being robust against a range of evasion attacks.},

  abstract = {Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is becoming increasingly mainstream as their applications continue to grow. These applications include remote healthcare monitoring, drug storage, alarm systems, and medical wearable devices. Remote patient monitoring, especially using wearable devices, has improved the health and protection of numerous people, while avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. Ideally, healthcare monitoring systems should accurately and timely detect if the patient is entering a critical condition, and alert the concerned doctor accordingly. However, in practice, there are two kinds of alarms raised by such systems, namely, events and anomalies. Events are non-erroneous data that do not conform to the expected values, indicating abnormality in the patient's condition. On the other hand, anomalies are erroneous data that may result from faulty sensors, electromagnetic interference, malicious attacks, or hardware tampering. These anomalies lead to false alarms which affect the decision making process and may cause danger to the patient's life. Traditionally, wearable MIoTs, measuring different vitals, frequently communicate with the patient's phone, or a local processing unit (LPU), in order to analyze and process the collected data. However, the increase in processing capabilities of IoT devices has made on-device event detection possible. This adds an extra layer of defense while avoiding unnecessary communication with LPU. In this paper, a healthcare monitoring system is proposed which compromises of two layers - (1) an online lightweight approach, based on multivariate long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder, embedded in each MIoT, that is able to detect data abnormality and alarms the LPU, (2) a correlation technique, at the LPU, that differentiates between anomalies and events, and alerts the patient's doctor only in case of an event. Since a single sensor reading does not provide enough clinical insight to detect the full length of an event, a feature engineering approach is implemented to extract interpretable statistical, dynamic and physiological features that provide the clinical insight needed. The proposed approach is simulated using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset for various vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is compared with four benchmarks, where the results show the robustness of the model in differentiating between anomalies and events, with event detection sensitivity and specificity above 93\%.},

  abstract = {The cyber world is plagued with ever-evolving malware that readily infiltrate all defense mechanisms, operate viciously unbeknownst to the user, and surreptitiously exfiltrate sensitive data. Understanding the inner workings of such malware provides a leverage to effectively combat them. This understanding is pursued often through dynamic analysis which is conducted manually or automatically. Malware authors accordingly, have devised and advanced evasion techniques to thwart or evade these analyses. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on malware dynamic analysis evasion techniques. In addition, we propose a detailed classification of these techniques and further demonstrate how their efficacy holds against different types of detection and analysis approaches.             Our observations attest that evasive behavior is mostly concerned with detecting and evading sandboxes. The primary tactic of such malware we argue is fingerprinting followed by new trends for reverse Turing test tactic which aims at detecting human interaction. Furthermore, we will posit that the current defensive strategies, beginning with reactive methods to endeavors for more transparent analysis systems, are readily foiled by zero-day fingerprinting techniques or other evasion tactics such as stalling. Accordingly, we would recommend the pursuit of more generic defensive strategies with an emphasis on path exploration techniques that has the potential to thwart all the evasive tactics.},

Unlike previous SMS phishing techniques, successful scammers interact with victims, rather than sending only one message which contains a URL. This recent impersonation technique has proven to be more effective worldwide and has been coined the `hi mum and dad' scam. In this paper, we collaborate with a UK-based mobile network operator to access the initial `hi mum and dad' scam messages and related user spam reports. We then interact with suspicious scammers pretending to be potential victims. We collect 582 unique mule accounts from 711 scammer interactions where scammers ask us to pay more than {\pounds}577k over three months. We find that scammers deceive their victims mainly by using kindness and distraction principles followed by the time principle. The paper presents how they abuse the services provided by mobile network operators and financial institutions to conduct this scam.

These graphs represent Markov chains, where the vertices are the instructions and the transition probabilities are estimated by the data contained in the trace. We use a combination of graph kernels to create a similarity matrix between the instruction trace graphs. The resulting graph kernel measures similarity between graphs on both local and global levels. Finally, the similarity matrix is sent to a support vector machine to perform classification. Our method is particularly appealing because we do not base our classifications on the raw n-gram data, but rather use our data representation to perform classification in graph space. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two classification problems: benign software versus malware, and the Netbull virus with different packers versus other classes of viruses. Our results show a statistically significant improvement over signature-based and other machine learning-based detection methods.},

As a result, most previous works have trained with little or no multi-modal data, which opens several drawbacks. Therefore, this study aims to develop a phishing data repository to meet the diverse data needs of the anti-phishing domain. As a result, a gap-filling solution named PhishRepo was proposed as an online data repository that collects, verifies, disseminates, and archives phishing data. It includes innovative design aspects such as automated submission, deduplication filtering, automated verification, crowdsourcing-based human interaction, an objection reporting window, and target attack prevention techniques. Moreover, the deduplication filter, used for the first time in phishing data collection, significantly impacted the collection process. It eliminated the duplicate data, which causes one of the most common machine learning errors known as data leakage. In addition, PhishRepo enables researchers to apply modern machine learning techniques effectively and supports them by eliminating phishing data hassle. Therefore, more thoughtful use of PhishRepo will lead to effective anti-phishing solutions in the future, minimising the social engineering crime called phishing.},

  abstract = {Mobile operating systems provide developers with various mobile-to-Web bridges to display Web pages inside native applications. A recently introduced component called Custom Tab (CT) provides an outstanding feature to overcome the usability limitations of traditional WebViews: it shares the state with the underlying browser. Similar to traditional WebViews, it can also keep the host application informed about ongoing Web navigations. In this paper, we perform the first systematic security evaluation of the CT component and show how the design of its security model did not consider cross-context state inference attacks when the feature was introduced. Additionally, we show how CTs can be exploited for fine-grained exfiltration of sensitive user browsing data, violation of Web session integrity by circumventing SameSite cookies, and how UI customization of the CT component can lead to phishing and information leakage. To assess the prevalence of CTs in the wild and the practicality of the mitigation strategies we propose, we carry out the first large-scale analysis of CT usage on over 50K Android applications. Our analysis reveals that their usage is widespread, with 83\% of applications embedding CTs either directly or as part of a library.We have responsibly disclosed all our findings to Google, which has already taken steps to apply targeted mitigations, assigned three CVEs for the discovered vulnerabilities, and awarded us \$10,000 in bounties. Our interaction with Google led to clarifications of the CT security model in the new Chrome Custom Tabs Security FAQ document.},

The use of data mining approach in matching ontology problem is reviewed in this article. We propose DMOM (Data Mining for Ontology Matching based instances) framework to select data properties of instances efficiently. The framework exploits data mining techniques to select the most appropriate features to match ontologies. Moreover, three strategies have been investigated to select the relevant features for the matching process. The first one called exhaustive, explores the enumerate search tree randomly by generating at each iteration a subset of feature attributes, where each node is evaluated by running the matching process on its selected attributes. The second approach called statistical, it uses some statistical values to select the most relevant properties. The third one called FIM (Frequent Itemsets Mining), it explores the correlation between different properties and selects the most frequent properties describing the overall instances of the given ontology. To demonstrate the usefulness of DMOM framework, several experiments have been carried out on OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) and DBpedia ontology databases. The results show that the third strategy, FIM, outperforms the two other strategies (Exhaustive, and Statistical). The results also reveal that DMOM outperforms the state-of-the-art ontology matching approaches in terms of execution time and the quality of the matching process.},

Our method, which we refer to as CopyCatch, detects lockstep Page Like patterns on Facebook by analyzing only the social graph between users and Pages and the times at which the edges in the graph (the Likes) were created. We offer the following contributions: (1) We give a novel problem formulation, with a simple concrete definition of suspicious behavior in terms of graph structure and edge constraints. (2) We offer two algorithms to find such suspicious lockstep behavior - one provably-convergent iterative algorithm and one approximate, scalable MapReduce implementation. (3) We show that our method severely limits "greedy attacks" and analyze the bounds from the application of the Zarankiewicz problem to our setting. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of CopyCatch at Facebook and on synthetic data, as well as potential extensions to anomaly detection problems in other domains. CopyCatch is actively in use at Facebook, searching for attacks on Facebook's social graph of over a billion users, many millions of Pages, and billions of Page Likes.},

By collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing DNS records, TLS certificates, phishing URLs, phishing website source code, phishing emails, web traffic to phishing websites, news articles, and government announcements, we track trends of phishing activity between January and May 2020 and seek to understand the key implications of the underlying trends.We find that phishing attack traffic in March and April 2020 skyrocketed up to 220\% of its pre-COVID-19 rate, far exceeding typical seasonal spikes. Attackers exploited victims' uncertainty and fear related to the pandemic through a variety of highly targeted scams, including emerging scam types against which current defenses are not sufficient as well as traditional phishing which outpaced the ecosystem's collective response.},

Detecting phishing kits in deployed websites might help to detect phishing campaigns earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets providing a set of phishing kits that are used in websites that were attacked by phishing. In this work, we propose PhiKitA, a novel dataset that contains phishing kits and also phishing websites generated using these kits. We have applied MD5 hashes, fingerprints, and graph representation DOM algorithms to obtain baseline results in PhiKitA in three experiments: familiarity analysis of phishing kit samples, phishing website detection and identifying the source of a phishing website. In the familiarity analysis, we find evidence of different types of phishing kits and a small phishing campaign. In the binary classification problem for phishing detection, the graph representation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.50\%, showing that the phishing kit data contain useful information to classify phishing. Finally, the MD5 hash representation obtained a 39.54\% F1 score, which means that this algorithm does not extract enough information to distinguish phishing websites and their phishing kit sources properly.},

However, the public still sees software development as a profession for "math wizards". To learn more about this special type of knowledge worker from their first-person perspective, we conducted three studies to learn how developers describe a day in their life through vlogs on YouTube and how these vlogs were received by the broader community. We first interviewed 16 developers who vlogged to identify their motivations for creating this content and their intention behind what they chose to portray. Second, we analyzed 130 vlogs (video blogs) to understand the range of the content conveyed through videos. Third, we analyzed 1176 comments from the 130 vlogs to understand the impact the vlogs have on the audience. We found that developers were motivated to promote and build a diverse community, by sharing different aspects of life that define their identity, and by creating awareness about learning and career opportunities in computing. They used vlogs to share a variety of how software developers work and live---showcasing often unseen experiences, including intimate moments from their personal life. From our comment analysis, we found that the vlogs were valuable to the audience to find information and seek advice. Commenters sought opportunities to connect with others over shared triumphs and trials they faced that were also shown in the vlogs. As a central theme, we found that developers use vlogs to challenge the misconceptions and stereotypes around their identity, work-life, and well-being. These social stigmas are obstacles to an inclusive and accepting community and can deter people from choosing software development as a career. We also discuss the implications of using vlogs to support developers, researchers, and beyond.},

The underlying problem is that popular GUI frameworks by design can potentially reveal every UI state change through a newly-discovered public side channel --- shared memory.

  abstract = {Size, accessibility, and rate of growth of Online Social Media (OSM) has attracted cyber crimes through them. One form of cyber crime that has been increasing steadily is phishing, where the goal (for the phishers) is to steal personal information from users which can be used for fraudulent purposes. Although the research community and industry has been developing techniques to identify phishing attacks through emails and instant messaging (IM), there is very little research done, that provides a deeper understanding of phishing in online social media. Due to constraints of limited text space in social systems like Twitter, phishers have begun to use URL shortener services. In this study, we provide an overview of phishing attacks for this new scenario. One of our main conclusions is that phishers are using URL shorteners not only for reducing space but also to hide their identity. We observe that social media websites like Facebook, Habbo, Orkut are competing with e-commerce services like PayPal, eBay in terms of traffic and focus of phishers. Orkut, Habbo, and Facebook are amongst the top 5 brands targeted by phishers. We study the referrals from Twitter to understand the evolving phishing strategy. A staggering 89\% of references from Twitter (users) are inorganic accounts which are sparsely connected amongst themselves, but have large number of followers and followees. We observe that most of the phishing tweets spread by extensive use of attractive words and multiple hashtags. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to connect the phishing landscape using blacklisted phishing URLs from PhishTank, URL statistics from bit.ly and cues from Twitter to track the impact of phishing in online social media.},

While in the past there has been significant work on defending from phishing, much less is known about the tools and techniques used by attackers, i.e., phishers. Of particular importance to understanding the phishers' methods and motivations are phishing kits, packages that contain complete phishing web sites in an easy-to-deploy format. In this paper, we study in detail the kits distributed for free in underground circles and those obtained by crawling live phishing sites. We notice that phishing kits often contain backdoors that send the entered information to third parties. We conclude that phishing kits target two classes of victims: the gullible users from whom they extort valuable information and the unexperienced phishers who deploy them.},

However, these methods mainly operate on raw sequences and may not effectively capture important information especially for multi-process malware, mainly due to the API call interleaving problem.   Motivated by that, this paper presents API2Vec, a graph based API embedding method for malware detection. First, we build a graph model to represent the raw sequence. In particular, we design the temporal process graph (TPG) to model inter-process behavior and temporal API graph (TAG) to model intra-process behavior. With such graphs, we design a heuristic random walk algorithm to generate a number of paths that can capture the fine-grained malware behavior. By pre-training the paths using the Doc2Vec model, we are able to generate the embeddings of paths and APIs, which can further be used for malware detection. The experiments on a real malware dataset demonstrate that API2Vec outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding methods and detection methods for both accuracy and robustness, especially for multi-process malware.},

Combatting phishing is thus a top-priority, and has been the focus of much work, both on the academic and on the industry sides. In this paper, we look at this problem from a new angle. We have monitored a total of 19,066 phishing attacks over a period of ten months and found that over 90\% of these attacks were actually replicas or variations of other attacks in the database. This provides several opportunities and insights for the fight against phishing: first, quickly and efficiently detecting replicas is a very effective prevention tool. We detail one such tool in this paper. Second, the widely held belief that phishing attacks are dealt with promptly is but an illusion. We have recorded numerous attacks that stay active throughout our observation period. This shows that the current prevention techniques are ineffective and need to be overhauled. We provide some suggestions in this direction. Third, our observation give a new perspective into the modus operandi of attackers. In particular, some of our observations suggest that a small group of attackers could be behind a large part of the current attacks. Taking down that group could potentially have a large impact on the phishing attacks observed today.},

  abstract = {Cloaking has long been exploited by spammers for the purpose of increasing the exposure of their websites. In other words, cloaking has long served as a major malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). Cloaking hides the true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users versus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of employing cloaking in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting cloaking is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP cloaking and are not suitable for detecting cloaking in SEM because their search-and-visit method leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring cloaking on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help them avoid frauds. Our work focuses on mitigating IP cloaking and SEM cloaking, and providing client-based real-time cloaking detection services. To achieve these goals, we first propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation of websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and implement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving system, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on demand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from the server and compares them with user views to detect cloaking. Since Cloaker Catcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP cloaking can be detected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using our system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM cloaking and found that the main purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services.},

  abstract = {The rapid increase in the number of Android malware poses great challenges to anti-malware systems, because the sheer number of malware samples overwhelms malware analysis systems. The classification of malware samples into families, such that the common features shared by malware samples in the same family can be exploited in malware detection and inspection, is a promising approach for accelerating malware analysis. Furthermore, the selection of representative malware samples in each family can drastically decrease the number of malware to be analyzed. However, the existing classification solutions are limited because of the following reasons. First, the legitimate part of the malware may misguide the classification algorithms because the majority of Android malware are constructed by inserting malicious components into popular apps. Second, the polymorphic variants of Android malware can evade detection by employing transformation attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that constructs frequent subgraphs (fregraphs) to represent the common behaviors of malware samples that belong to the same family. Moreover, we propose and develop FalDroid, a novel system that automatically classifies Android malware and selects representative malware samples in accordance with fregraphs. We apply it to 8407 malware samples from 36 families. Experimental results show that FalDroid can correctly classify 94.2\% of malware samples into their families using approximately 4.6 sec per app. FalDroid can also dramatically reduce the cost of malware investigation by selecting only 8.5\% to 22\% representative samples that exhibit the most common malicious behavior among all samples.},

Nevertheless, attackers with specific and internal knowledge of a target system may be able to produce input samples which are misclassified. In practice, the assumption of strong attackers is not realistic as it implies access to insider information. We instead propose HideNoSeek, a novel and generic camouflage attack, which evades the entire class of detectors based on syntactic features, without needing any information about the system it is trying to evade. Our attack consists of changing the constructs of malicious JavaScript samples to reproduce a benign syntax. For this purpose, we automatically rewrite the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of malicious JavaScript inputs into existing benign ones. In particular, HideNoSeek uses malicious seeds and searches for isomorphic subgraphs between the seeds and traditional benign scripts. Specifically, it replaces benign sub-ASTs by their malicious equivalents (same syntactic structure) and adjusts the benign data dependencies--without changing the AST--, so that the malicious semantics is kept. In practice, we leveraged 23 malicious seeds to generate 91,020 malicious scripts, which perfectly reproduce ASTs of Alexa top 10,000 web pages. Also, we can produce on average 14 different malicious samples with the same AST as each Alexa top 10. Overall, a standard trained classifier has 99.98\% false negatives with HideNoSeek inputs, while a classifier trained on such samples has over 88.74\% false positives, rendering the targeted static detectors unreliable.},

  abstract = {In this survey, we review the key developments in the field of malware detection using AI and analyze core challenges. We systematically survey state-of-the-art methods across five critical aspects of building an accurate and robust AI-powered malware-detection model: malware sophistication, analysis techniques, malware repositories, feature selection, and machine learning vs. deep learning. The effectiveness of an AI model is dependent on the quality of the features it is trained with. In turn, the quality and authenticity of these features is dependent on the quality of the dataset and the suitability of the analysis tool. Static analysis is fast but is limited by the widespread use of obfuscation. Dynamic analysis is not impacted by obfuscation but is defeated by ubiquitous anti-analysis techniques and requires more computational power. Sophisticated and evasive malware is challenging to extract authentic discriminatory features from and, combined with poor quality datasets, this can lead to a situation where a model achieves high accuracy with only one specific dataset.},

  abstract = {Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.},

Detection mechanisms dependent on signatures for attack detection perform poorly due to high false negatives. This limitation is attributed to the inability to detect zero-day attacks, polymorphic malware, increasing signature base, and detection speed. To achieve rapid detection, automated system-level malware detection using machine learning approaches, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to identify and mitigate malware attacks, has emerged as a promising solution. This comprehensive review aims to provides a detailed analysis of the status quo in malware detection by exploring the fundamentals of machine learning techniques for malware detection. The review is largely based on the PRISMA approach for article search methods and selection from four databases. Keywords were identified together with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review seeks feature extraction and selection methods that enhance the accuracy and precision of detection algorithms. Evaluation metrics and common datasets were used to assess the performance of the system-level malware detection techniques. A comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses, and performance in detecting system-level malware is presented together with the limitations of the detection techniques. The paper concludes with future research opportunities, particularly in applying artificial intelligence, and provides a resource for researchers and cybersecurity professionals seeking to understand and advance automated system-level malware detection using machine learning.},

Our study presents accurate measurements of the duration and effectiveness of this popular threat, and discusses many new and interesting aspects we observed by monitoring hundreds of phishing campaigns.},

However, researchers have long been reluctant to investigate server-side vulnerabilities at scale, as this could harm servers, disrupt service, and cause financial damage. This can lead to operator backlash and problems in peer review, as the boundaries posed by the law, ethics, and operators' stance towards security research are largely unclear.In this paper, we address this research gap and investigate the boundaries of server-side scanning (3S) on the Web. To that end, we devise five typical scenarios for 3S on the Web to obtain concrete practical guidance. We analyze qualitative data from 23 interviews with legal experts, using German law as a case study, members of Research Ethics Committees, and website and server operators to learn what types of 3S are considered acceptable and which behavior would cross a red line. To verify our findings, we further conduct an online survey with 119 operators.Our analysis of these different perspectives shows that the absence of judicial decisions and clear ethical guidelines poses challenges in overcoming the risks associated with 3S, despite a slight majority (57\%) of operators having a positive stance towards such academic research throughout the interviews and the survey. As a first step to mitigate these challenges, we suggest best practices for future 3S research and a pre-registration process to provide a reliable and transparent environment for 3S-based research that reduces uncertainty for researchers and operators alike.},

While most current methods emphasize the visual aspects of phishing websites, in this paper, we investigate the underlying structure by collecting data on style sheets and certificates from both verified phishing domains and benign domains. Using a token-based similarity algorithm, we group the phishing domains into three categories and identify shared characteristics of these domains. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using structural similarities to identify a website created using a phishing kit. By employing such detection, users would be able to browse the web with a reduced risk of falling victim to malicious activities.},

This intelligence can be put towards a wide variety of beneficial tasks, yet it can also be used to cause harm. This study explores one such harm by examining how LLMs can be used for spear phishing, a form of cybercrime that involves manipulating targets into divulging sensitive information. I first explore LLMs' ability to assist with the reconnaissance and message generation stages of a spear phishing attack, where I find that LLMs are capable of assisting with the email generation phase of a spear phishing attack. To explore how LLMs could potentially be harnessed to scale spear phishing campaigns, I then create unique spear phishing messages for over 600 British Members of Parliament using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. My findings provide some evidence that these messages are not only realistic but also cost-effective, with each email costing only a fraction of a cent to generate. Next, I demonstrate how basic prompt engineering can circumvent safeguards installed in LLMs, highlighting the need for further research into robust interventions that can help prevent models from being misused. To further address these evolving risks, I explore two potential solutions: structured access schemes, such as application programming interfaces, and LLM-based defensive systems.},

While device fingerprinting and its detection has been extensively studied in the context of web browsing, little research has been conducted on device fingerprinting in mobile apps and especially iOS apps.

We develop a classifier that finds hundreds of real-world lateral phishing emails, while generating under four false positives per every one-million employeesent emails. Drawing on the attacks we detect, as well as a corpus of user-reported incidents, we quantify the scale of lateral phishing, identify several thematic content and recipient targeting strategies that attackers follow, illuminate two types of sophisticated behaviors that attackers exhibit, and estimate the success rate of these attacks. Collectively, these results expand our mental models of the `enterprise attacker' and shed light on the current state of enterprise phishing attacks.},

  abstract = {Websites unfortunately play a powerful role in delivering malicious content to users during cyberattacks. In particular, the threat of phishing websites that tricks users by abusing their corporate and brand names is increasing. Building a website requires infrastructure costs (e.g., domain name fees) and operational costs (e.g., managing server settings). Additionally, many companies spend considerable resources managing their own IT assets and security countermeasures. Even when phishing websites are taken down, attackers persist by scrapping and rebuilding them, as doing so is inexpensive. Notably, there are significant differences in website building costs between companies and attackers. In this study, we propose a method of analyzing the costs incurred in a process of building websites from domain name registration to website deployment to detect phishing websites. We evaluate our method using data from 1,082 large corporate websites and 1,163 phishing websites. As a result, our method achieves a detection performance of 95\% precision and 96\% recall. In addition, we show that our method still achieves a 95\% recall for 866 phishing websites even after six months and the indicator of website building costs is robust to concept drift. We further discuss the applicability of the cost indicator.},

We first conduct a systematic feature engineering study on thousands of benign and malicious websites from the perspective of system provenance data. In our study, we discover eight useful features for malicious website detection. Based on these eight features, we propose ProvWeb, a novel non-intrusive system provenance-based tool, for malicious website detection. In our evaluation, ProvWeb can achieve an F1 score of 93.7\% {$\sim$} 99.7\% for the four combinations of browsers and OSes (Windows Chrome, Windows Firefox, Linux Chrome, Linux Firefox). This result confirms that the features discovered in provenance graphs are effective in detecting malicious websites.},

Consequently, research on applying and designing ML algorithms and systems for security has grown fast, ranging from intrusion detection systems(IDS) and malware classification to security policy management(SPM) and information leak checking. In this paper, we systematically study the methods, algorithms, and system designs in academic publications from 2008-2015 that applied ML in security domains. 98 percent of the surveyed papers appeared in the 6 highest-ranked academic security conferences and 1 conference known for pioneering ML applications in security. We examine the generalized system designs, underlying assumptions, measurements, and use cases in active research. Our examinations lead to 1) a taxonomy on ML paradigms and security domains for future exploration and exploitation, and 2) an agenda detailing open and upcoming challenges. Based on our survey, we also suggest a point of view that treats security as a game theory problem instead of a batch-trained ML problem.},

To this end, we present BinSum, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset of over 557K binary functions and introduce a novel method for prompt synthesis and optimization. To more accurately gauge LLM performance, we also propose a new semantic similarity metric that surpasses traditional exactmatch approaches. Our extensive evaluation of prominent LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, Llama 2, and Code Llama, reveals 10 pivotal insights. This evaluation generates 4 billion inference tokens, incurred a total expense of 11,418 US dollars and 873 NVIDIA A100 GPU hours. Our findings highlight both the transformative potential of LLMs in this field and the challenges yet to be overcome.},

  abstract = {Taint-style vulnerabilities, such as OS command injection and path traversal, are common and severe software weaknesses. There exists an inherent trade-off between analysis scalability and accuracy in detecting such vulnerabilities. On one hand, existing syntax-directed approaches often make compromises in the analysis accuracy on dynamic features like bracket syntax. On the other hand, existing abstract interpretation often faces the issue of state explosion in the abstract domain, thus leading to a scalability problem.In this paper, we present a novel approach, called FAST, to scale the vulnerability discovery of JavaScript packages via a novel abstract interpretation approach that relies on two new techniques, called bottom-up and top-down abstract interpretation. The former abstractly interprets functions based on scopes instead of call sequences to construct dynamic call edges. Then, the latter follows specific control-flow paths and prunes the program to skip statements unrelated to the sink. If an end-to-end data-flow path is found, FAST queries the satisfiability of constraints along the path and verifies the exploitability to reduce human efforts.We implement a prototype of FAST and evaluate it against real-world Node.js packages. We show that FAST is able to find 242 zero-day vulnerabilities in NPM with 21 CVE identifiers being assigned. Our evaluation also shows that FAST can scale to real-world applications such as NodeBB and popular frameworks such as total.js and strapi in finding legacy vulnerabilities that no prior works can.},

Many cyber attacks are spread via mechanisms that exploit weaknesses found in endusers, which makes users the weakest element in the security chain. The phishing problem is broad and no single silver-bullet solution exists to mitigate all the vulnerabilities effectively, thus multiple techniques are often implemented to mitigate specific attacks. This paper aims at surveying many of the recently proposed phishing mitigation techniques. A high-level overview of various categories of phishing mitigation techniques is also presented, such as: detection, offensive defense, correction, and prevention, which we belief is critical to present where the phishing detection techniques fit in the overall mitigation process.},

Man-in-the- Middle (MITM) phishing toolkits are the latest evolution in this space, where toolkits act as malicious reverse proxy servers of online services, mirroring live content to users while extracting cre- dentials and session cookies in transit. These tools further reduce the work required by attackers, automate the harvesting of 2FA- authenticated sessions, and substantially increase the believability of phishing web pages.In this paper, we present the first analysis of MITM phishing toolkits used in the wild. By analyzing and experimenting with these toolkits, we identify intrinsic network-level properties that can be used to identify them. Based on these properties, we develop a machine learning classifier that identifies the presence of such toolkits in online communications with 99.9\% accuracy.We conduct a large-scale longitudinal study of MITM phishing toolkits by creating a data-collection framework that monitors and crawls suspicious URLs from public sources. Using this infrastruc- ture, we capture data on 1,220 MITM phishing websites over the course of a year. We discover that MITM phishing toolkits occupy a blind spot in phishing blocklists, with only 43.7\% of domains and 18.9\% of IP addresses associated with MITM phishing toolkits present on blocklists, leaving unsuspecting users vulnerable to these attacks. Our results show that our detection scheme is resilient to the cloaking mechanisms incorporated by these tools, and is able to detect previously hidden phishing content. Finally, we propose methods that online services can utilize to fingerprint requests origi- nating from these toolkits and stop phishing attempts as they occur.},

Drawing from our insights into variable usage conventions in Linux, we enhance path analysis using post-constraint guidance. This approach, combined with our methodically crafted procedures, empowers LLift to adeptly handle the challenges of bug-specific modeling, extensive codebases, and the unpredictable nature of LLMs. Our real-world evaluations identified four previously undiscovered UBI bugs in the mainstream Linux kernel, which the Linux community has acknowledged. This study reaffirms the potential of marrying static analysis with LLMs, setting a compelling direction for future research in this area.},

On the other hand, prior works on C/C++ and PHP have proposed graph querybased approaches, such as Code Property Graph (CPG), to efficiently mine vulnerabilities, but they are not directly applicable to JavaScript due to the language's extensive use of dynamic features. In the paper, we propose flow- and context-sensitive static analysis with hybrid branch-sensitivity and points-to information to generate a novel graph structure, called Object Dependence Graph (ODG), using abstract interpretation. ODG represents JavaScript objects as nodes and their relations with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as edges, and accepts graph queries---especially on object lookups and definitions---for detecting Node.js vulnerabilities.},

To understand this emerging phenomenon in GitHub, we investigate the popularity of the learning projects and learners' CL activities, first on the extracted GHTorrent learning projects and then on a selected sample of 105 popular learning projects. We then conduct an online survey of 301 learners to qualitatively understand their practices and perceptions of CL in GitHub. Our main findings reveal that the learners' CL practices show some different characteristics from those of open source development, e.g., the learning projects have very few long-term contributors (less than 5\% of all contributors). Moreover, although the learners benefit from conducting personalized learning with the high-quality content and contributions made by the community, they encounter challenges in maintaining initiatives to conduct continuous unsupervised learning and in ensuring the quality of content and contributions. Based on the findings, we discuss the reasons behind the growth of CL and provide implications on the CL platform design.},

Second, we provide evidence of hidden risk in educational repositories contributing to the opportunities of potential threats and malicious intents. We carry out a systematic study on a collection of 35.2K GitHub repositories claimed to be created for educational purposes only. First, our study finds an increasing trend in the number of such repositories published every year. Second, 9294 of them are labeled by ChatGPT as malicious, and further categorization of the malicious ones detects 14 different malware families including DDoS, keylogger, ransomware and so on.

This paper explores speculative side-channel attacks and their implications for programming languages. These attacks leak information through micro-architectural side-channels which we show are not mere bugs, but in fact lie at the foundation of optimization. We identify three open problems, (1) finding side-channels, (2) understanding speculative vulnerabilities, and (3) mitigating them. For (1) we introduce a mathematical meta-model that clarifies the source of side-channels in simulations and CPUs. For (2) we introduce an architectural model with speculative semantics to study recently-discovered vulnerabilities. For (3) we explore and evaluate software mitigations and prove one correct for this model. Our analysis is informed by extensive offensive research and defensive implementation work for V8, the production JavaScript virtual machine in Chrome. Straightforward extensions to model real hardware suggest these vulnerabilities present formidable challenges for effective, efficient mitigation. As a result of our work, we now believe that speculative vulnerabilities on today's hardware defeat all language-enforced confidentiality with no known comprehensive software mitigations, as we have discovered that untrusted code can construct a universal read gadget to read all memory in the same address space through side-channels. In the face of this reality, we have shifted the security model of the Chrome web browser and V8 to process isolation.},

  abstract = {Attackers (``phishers'') typically deploy source code in some host website to impersonate a brand or in general a situation in which a user is expected to provide some personal information of interest to phishers (e.g. credentials, credit card number). Phishing kits are ready-to-deploy sets of files that can be simply copied on a web server and used almost as they are. In this paper, we consider the static similarity analysis of the source code of 20 871 phishing kits totalling over 182 million lines of PHP, Javascript and HTML code, that have been collected during phishing attacks and recovered by forensics teams. Reported experimental results show that as much as 90\% of the analyzed kits share 90\% or more of their source code with at least another kit. Differences are small, less than about 1000 programming words -- identifiers, constants, strings and so on -- in 40\% of cases. A plausible lineage of phishing kits is presented by connecting together kits with the highest similarity. Obtained results show a very different reconstructed lineage for phishing kits when compared to a publicly available application such as Wordpress. Observed kits similarity distribution is consistent with the assumed hypothesis that kit propagation is often based on identical or near-identical copies at low cost changes. The proposed approach may help classifying new incoming phishing kits as ''near-copy'' or ''intellectual leaps'' from known and already encountered kits. This could facilitate the identification and classification of new kits as derived from older known kits.},

  abstract = {Online toxicity is ubiquitous across the internet and its negative impact on the people and that online communities that it effects has been well documented. However, toxicity manifests differently on various platforms and toxicity in open source communities, while frequently discussed, is not well understood. We take a first stride at understanding the characteristics of open source toxicity to better inform future work on designing effective intervention and detection methods. To this end, we curate a sample of 100 toxic GitHub issue discussions combining multiple search and sampling strategies. We then qualitatively analyze the sample to gain an understanding of the characteristics of open-source toxicity. We find that the pervasive forms of toxicity in open source differ from those observed on other platforms like Reddit or Wikipedia. In our sample, some of the most prevalent forms of toxicity are entitled, demanding, and arrogant comments from project users as well as insults arising from technical disagreements. In addition, not all toxicity was written by people external to the projects; project members were also common authors of toxicity. We also discuss the implications of our findings. Among others we hope that our findings will be useful for future detection work.},

Based on this technology, a new form of parasitic computing, widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining, has gained momentum in the web. A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. For this, we propose a 3-phase analysis approach, which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites. We find that cryptojacking is common, with currently 1 out of 500 sites hosting a mining script. Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape, including a measurement of code characteristics, an estimate of expected mining revenue, and an evaluation of current blacklist-based countermeasures.},

In this paper, we isolate and identify these detection gaps by measuring the end-toend life cycle of large-scale phishing attacks. We develop a unique framework---Golden Hour---that allows us to passively measure victim traffic to phishing pages while proactively protecting tens of thousands of accounts in the process. Over a one year period, our network monitor recorded 4.8 million victims who visited phishing pages, excluding crawler traffic. We use these events and related data sources to dissect phishing campaigns: from the time they first come online, to email distribution, to visitor traffic, to ecosystem detection, and finally to account compromise. We find the average campaign from start to the last victim takes just 21 hours. At least 7.42\% of visitors supply their credentials and ultimately experience a compromise and subsequent fraudulent transaction. Furthermore, a small collection of highly successful campaigns are responsible for 89.13\% of victims. Based on our findings, we outline potential opportunities to respond to these sophisticated attacks.},

At the same time, the growing level of sophistication of cybercriminals must be understood for the development of effective anti-phishing systems, as phishers have extensive control over the content they serve to their victims. By examining two large, real-world datasets of phishing kits and URLs from 2016 through mid2017, we paint a clear picture of today's anti-phishing ecosystem while inferring the higher-level motives and thought processes of phishers. We analyze the nature of server-side .htaccess filtering techniques used by phishers to evade detection by the security community. We also propose a new generic classification scheme for phishing URLs which corresponds to modern social engineering techniques and reveals a correlation between URL type and compromised infrastructure use. Our analysis identifies measures that can be taken by the security community to defeat phishers' countermeasures and increase the likelihood of a timely response to phishing. We discover that phishers have a keen awareness of the infrastructure used against them, which illustrates the ever-evolving struggle between cybercriminals and security researchers and motivates future work to positively impact online security.},

Simultaneously, modern phishing websites are growing in sophistication by employing diverse cloaking techniques to avoid detection by security infrastructure. In this paper, we present PhishFarm: a scalable framework for methodically testing the resilience of anti-phishing entities and browser blacklists to attackers' evasion efforts. We use PhishFarm to deploy 2,380 live phishing sites (on new, unique, and previously-unseen .com domains) each using one of six different HTTP request filters based on real phishing kits. We reported subsets of these sites to 10 distinct anti-phishing entities and measured both the occurrence and timeliness of native blacklisting in major web browsers to gauge the effectiveness of protection ultimately extended to victim users and organizations. Our experiments revealed shortcomings in current infrastructure, which allows some phishing sites to go unnoticed by the security community while remaining accessible to victims. We found that simple cloaking techniques representative of real-world attacks--- including those based on geolocation, device type, or JavaScript---were effective in reducing the likelihood of blacklisting by over 55\% on average. We also discovered that blacklisting did not function as intended in popular mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox), which left users of these browsers particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks. Following disclosure of our findings, anti-phishing entities are now better able to detect and mitigate several cloaking techniques (including those that target mobile users), and blacklisting has also become more consistent between desktop and mobile platforms--- but work remains to be done by anti-phishing entities to ensure users are adequately protected. Our PhishFarm framework is designed for continuous monitoring of the ecosystem and can be extended to test future state-of-the-art evasion techniques used by malicious websites.},

Computer Security has the natural benefit of creating artifacts that should facilitate computational reproducibility, the ability for others to use someone else's code and data to independently recreate results, in a relatively straightforward fashion. While the Security community has recently increased its attention on reproducibility, an independent and comprehensive measurement of the current state of reproducibility has not been conducted. In this paper, we perform the first such study, targeting reproducible artifacts generated specifically by papers on machine learning security (one of the most popular areas in academic research) published in Tier 1 security conferences over the past ten years (2013-2022). We perform our measurement study of indirect and direct reproducibility over nearly 750 papers, their codebases, and datasets. Our analysis shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the availability of artifacts before and after the introduction of Artifact Evaluation Committees in Tier 1 conferences. However, based on three years of results, artifacts that pass through this process work at a higher rate than those that do not. From our collected findings, we offer data-driven suggestions for improving reproducibility in our community, including five common problems observed in our study. In so doing, we demonstrate that significant progress still needs to be made in computational reproducibility in Computer Security research.},

  abstract = {Although malicious software (malware) has been around since the early days of computers, the sophistication and innovation of malware has increased over the years. In particular, the latest crop of ransomware has drawn attention to the dangers of malicious software, which can cause harm to private users as well as corporations, public services (hospitals and transportation systems), governments, and security institutions. To protect these institutions and the public from malware attacks, malicious activity must be detected as early as possible, preferably before it conducts its harmful acts. However, it is not always easy to know what to look for---especially when dealing with new and unknown malware that has never been seen. Analyzing a suspicious file by static or dynamic analysis methods can provide relevant and valuable information regarding a file's impact on the hosting system and help determine whether the file is malicious or not, based on the method's predefined rules. While various techniques (e.g., code obfuscation, dynamic code loading, encryption, and packing) can be used by malware writers to evade static analysis (including signature-based anti-virus tools), dynamic analysis is robust to these techniques and can provide greater understanding regarding the analyzed file and consequently can lead to better detection capabilities. Although dynamic analysis is more robust than static analysis, existing dynamic analysis tools and techniques are imperfect, and there is no single tool that can cover all aspects of malware behavior. The most recent comprehensive survey performed in this area was published in 2012. Since that time, the computing environment has changed dramatically with new types of malware (ransomware, cryptominers), new analysis methods (volatile memory forensics, side-channel analysis), new computing environments (cloud computing, IoT devices), new machine-learning algorithms, and more. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of existing methods used to dynamically analyze malware, which includes a description of each method, its strengths and weaknesses, and its resilience against malware evasion techniques. In addition, we include an overview of prominent studies presenting the usage of machine-learning methods to enhance dynamic malware analysis capabilities aimed at detection, classification, and categorization.},

Specifically, for the measurement, we collect a data set of 320,000+ CI/CD pipeline-configured GitHub repositories and build an analysis tool to parse the CI/CD pipelines and extract security-critical usages. Our measurement reveals that the script runtimes are prone to code hiding while the script usage update is not in time, giving attackers chances to hide malicious code and exploit existing vulnerabilities. Moreover, even the scripts from verified creators may contain severe vulnerabilities. Besides current CI/CD ecosystem heavily relies on several core scripts, which may lead to a single point of failure. While the CI/CD pipelines contain sensitive information/operations, making them the attacker's favorite targets.},

Machine learning anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity nowadays. However, most anti-phishing solutions rely heavily on features extracted from third-party services such as whois services, DNS search, and web traffic. As a result, they are slow and require a lot of computing resources. This paper introduces a machine-learning-based framework: Phish-Sight that detects phishing websites through a visual inspection strategy. Phish-Sight uses dominant color features and highly targeted popular brand names embedded in URLs' web pages with machine learning techniques to detect phishing web pages. Prediction performance of the dominant color features and popular brand names from web pages was investigated using five machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm surpassed the others, with a 98.43\% true positive rate and 99.13\% accuracy in detecting phishing frauds. The prediction run time per web page measured at 7.6~s suggests that Phish-Sight has potential for real-time applications.},

In this paper, we focus on phishing campaigns against the web portal service with the largest number of users (42 million) in South Korea. We harvest 1,558 phishing URLs from varying resources in the span of a full year, of which only a small fraction (3.8\%) have been detected by eCrimeX despite a wide spectrum of active fraudulence cases. We demystify three pervasive types of phishing campaigns in South Korea: i) sophisticated phishing campaigns with varying adversarial tactics such as a proxy configuration, ii) phishing campaigns against a second-hand online market, and iii) phishing campaigns against a non-specific target. Aligned with previous findings, a phishing kit that supports automating the whole phishing campaign is prevalent. Besides, we frequently observe a hit-andrun scam where a phishing campaign is immediately inaccessible right after victimization is complete, each of which is tailored to a single potential victim over a new channel like a messenger. As part of mitigation efforts, we promptly provide regional phishing information to APWG, and immediately lock down a victim's account to prevent further damages.},

  abstract = {Is Android malware classification a solved problem? Published F1 scores of up to 0.99 appear to leave very little room for improvement. In this paper, we argue that results are commonly inflated due to two pervasive sources of experimental bias: spatial bias caused by distributions of training and testing data that are not representative of a real-world deployment; and temporal bias caused by incorrect time splits of training and testing sets, leading to impossible configurations. We propose a set of space and time constraints for experiment design that eliminates both sources of bias. We introduce a new metric that summarizes the expected robustness of a classifier in a real-world setting, and we present an algorithm to tune its performance. Finally, we demonstrate how this allows us to evaluate mitigation strategies for time decay such as active learning. We have implemented our solutions in TESSERACT, an open source evaluation framework for comparing malware classifiers in a realistic setting. We used TESSERACT to evaluate three Android malware classifiers from the literature on a dataset of 129K applications spanning over three years. Our evaluation confirms that earlier published results are biased, while also revealing counter-intuitive performance and showing that appropriate tuning can lead to significant improvements.},

This study expands the scope to include a comprehensive evaluation of client-side anti-phishing techniques within the Chrome browser, alongside an in-depth analysis of academic research in the field of phishing over the past five years. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of current client-side anti-phishing measures, which demonstrated a detection rate of only 14\% for phishing websites and blocked merely 10\% of login-based phishing sites within the first hour, resulting in a substantial false negative rate. Additionally, our analysis reveals that attackers can readily circumvent these defenses by altering the content of phishing websites. The study also critically assesses recent academic contributions to understand their alignment and potential integration with client-side anti-phishing frameworks. Based on these insights, we propose targeted recommendations to enhance the efficacy and responsiveness of the client-side anti-phishing ecosystem, addressing the challenges of low detection coverage, slow response times, and high rates of false negatives.},

In this paper, we propose a new technique which detects phishing sites with word embeddings using plain text and domain specific text extracted from the source code. We applied various word embedding for the evaluation of our model using ensemble and multimodal approaches. From the experimental evaluation, we observed that multimodal with domain specific text achieved a significant accuracy of 99.34\% with TPR of 99.59\%, FPR of 0.93\%, and MCC of 98.68\%},

Recent techniques use search engine based approach to counter the phishing attacks as it achieves promising detection accuracy. But, the limitation of this approach is that it fails when phishing page is hosted on compromised server. Moreover, it also results in low true negative rate when newly registered or non-popular domains are encountered. Hence, in this paper, we propose an application named as Jail-Phish, which improves the accuracy of the search engine based techniques with an ability to detect the Phishing Sites Hosted on Compromised Servers (PSHCS) and also detection of newly registered legitimate sites. Jail-Phish compares the suspicious site and matched domain in the search results for calculating the similarity score between them. There exists some degree of similarity such as logos, favicons, images, scripts, styles, and anchorlinks within the pages of the same website whereas on the other side, the dissimilarity within the pages is very high in PSHCS. Hence, we use the similarity score between the suspicious site and matched domain as a parameter to detect the PSHCS. From the experimental results, it is observed that Jail-Phish achieved an accuracy of 98.61\%, true positive rate of 97.77\% and false positive rate less than 0.64\%.},

With the prevalence of private user data stored on web sites, the risk posed by compromised renderer processes, and the advent of transient execution attacks like Spectre and Meltdown that can leak data via microarchitectural state, it is no longer safe to render documents from different web sites in the same process. In this paper, we describe our successful deployment of the Site Isolation architecture to all desktop users of Google Chrome as a mitigation for process-wide attacks. Site Isolation locks each renderer process to documents from a single site and filters certain cross-site data from each process. We overcame performance and compatibility challenges to adapt a production browser to this new architecture. We find that this architecture offers the best path to protection against compromised renderer processes and same-process transient execution attacks, despite current limitations. Our performance results indicate it is practical to deploy this level of isolation while sufficiently preserving compatibility with existing web content. Finally, we discuss future directions and how the current limitations of Site Isolation might be addressed.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being applied to malicious JavaScript detection in response to the growing number of Web attacks and the attendant costly manual identification. In practice, to hide their malicious behaviors or protect intellectual copyrights, both malicious and benign scripts tend to obfuscate their own code before uploading. While obfuscation is beneficial, it also introduces some additional code features (e.g., dead code) into the code. When machine learning is employed to learn a malicious JavaScript detector, these additional features can affect the model to make it less effective. However, there is still a lack of clear understanding of how robust existing machine learning-based detectors are on different obfuscators. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to figure out how obfuscation affects machine learning detectors based on static features. Through the results, we observe several findings: 1) Obfuscation has a significant impact on the effectiveness of detectors, causing an increase both in false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR), and the bias of obfuscation in the training set induces detectors to detect obfuscation rather than malicious behaviors. 2) The common measures such as improving the quality of the training set by adding relevant obfuscated samples and leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models can not work well.3) The root cause of obfuscation effects on these detectors is that feature spaces they use can only reflect shallow differences in code, not about the nature of benign and malicious, which can be easily affected by the differences brought by obfuscation. 4) Obfuscation has a similar effect on realistic detectors in VirusTotal, indicating that this is a common real-world problem.},

  abstract = {The advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them invaluable across various applications, from conversational agents and content creation to data analysis, research, and innovation. However, their effectiveness and accessibility also render them susceptible to abuse for generating malicious content, including phishing attacks. This study explores the potential of using four popular commercially available LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 Turbo), GPT 4, Claude, and Bard, to generate functional phishing attacks using a series of malicious prompts. We discover that these LLMs can generate both phishing websites and emails that can convincingly imitate well-known brands and also deploy a range of evasive tactics that are used to elude detection mechanisms employed by anti-phishing systems. These attacks can be generated using unmodified or "vanilla" versions of these LLMs without requiring any prior adversarial exploits such as jailbreaking. We evaluate the performance of the LLMs towards generating these attacks and find that they can also be utilized to create malicious prompts that, in turn, can be fed back to the model to generate phishing scams - thus massively reducing the prompt-engineering effort required by attackers to scale these threats. As a countermeasure, we build a BERT-based automated detection tool that can be used for the early detection of malicious prompts to prevent LLMs from generating phishing content. Our model is transferable across all four commercial LLMs, attaining an average accuracy of 96\% for phishing website prompts and 94\% for phishing email prompts. We also disclose the vulnerabilities to the concerned LLMs, with Google acknowledging it as a severe issue. Our detection model is available for use at Hugging Face, as well as a ChatGPT Actions plugin.},

Using FreePhish, we were able to detect and characterize more than 31.4K phishing URLs that were created using 17 unique free website builder services and shared on Twitter and Facebook over a period of six months. We find that FWBs provide attackers with several features that make it easier to create and maintain phishing websites at scale while simultaneously evading anti-phishing countermeasures. Our study indicates that antiphishing blocklists and browser protection tools have significantly lower coverage and high detection time against FWB phishing attacks when compared to regular (self-hosted) phishing websites. While our prompt disclosure of these attacks helped some FWBs to remove these attacks, we found several others who were slow at removal or did not remove them outright, with the same also being true for Twitter and Facebook. Finally, we also provide FreePhish as a free Chromium web extension that can be utilized to prevent end-users from accessing potential FWB-based phishing attacks.},

  abstract = {With the recent rise of HTTPS adoption on the Web, attackers have begun ``HTTPSifying'' phishing websites. HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. Furthermore, we developed a real-time monitoring system using the analysis techniques. We demonstrate its usefulness for the practical security operation. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs.},

  abstract = {Malicious websites often mimic top brands to host malware and launch social engineering attacks, e.g., to collect user credentials. Some such sites often attempt to hide malicious content from search engine crawlers (e.g., Googlebot), but show harmful content to users/client browsers---a technique known as cloaking. Past studies uncovered various aspects of cloaking, using selected categories of websites (e.g., mimicking specific types of malicious sites). We focus on understanding cloaking behaviors using a broader set of websites. As a way forward, we built a crawler to automatically browse and analyze content from 100000 squatting (mostly) malicious domains---domains that are generated through typo-squatting and combo-squatting of 2883 popular websites. We use a headless Chrome browser and a search-engine crawler with user-agent modifications to identify cloaking behaviors---a challenging task due to dynamic content, served at random; e.g., consecutive requests serve very different malicious or benign content. Most malicious sites (e.g., phishing and malware) go undetected by current blacklists; only a fraction of cloaked sites (127, 3.3\%) are flagged as malicious by VirusTotal. In contrast, we identify 80\% cloaked sites as malicious, via a semi-automated process implemented by extending the content categorization functionality of Symantec's SiteReview tool. Even after 3 months of observation, nearly a half (1024, 45.4\%) of the cloaked sites remained active, and only a few (31, 3\%) of them are flagged by VirusTotal. This clearly indicate that existing blacklists are ineffective against cloaked malicious sites. Our techniques can serve as a starting point for more effective and scalable early detection of cloaked malicious sites.},

In this paper, we present an automated web-based malicious campaign detection system that produces campaign signatures representing both their static and dynamic behavior. We generated 379 campaign signatures that matched 36,427 unique malicious URLs with an extremely low false-positive rate (0.008\%). We further applied our signatures on real world user traffic and identified 471 URLs, which were verified through VirusTotal and manual inspection. Our results provide valuable insight into web-based malicious campaign detection and our system could be utilized to improve existing defenses and the relevant field of threat intelligence.},

However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs.},

  abstract = {The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.1 Disclaimer. This paper contains examples of harmful language.

Security researchers and vendors have tried to prevent the attacks by detecting malicious data, i.e., malicious URLs, web content, and redirections. However, attackers conceal a part of malicious data with evasion techniques to circumvent detection systems. In this paper, we propose a system for detecting malicious websites without collecting all malicious data. Even if we cannot observe a part of malicious data, we can always observe compromised websites. Since vulnerable websites are discovered by search engines, compromised websites have similar traits. Therefore, we built a classifier by leveraging not only malicious websites but also compromised websites. More precisely, we convert all websites observed at the time of access into a redirection graph and classify it by integrating similarities between its subgraphs and redirection subgraphs shared across malicious, benign, and compromised websites. As a result of evaluating our system with crawling data of 455,860 websites, we found that the system achieved a 91.7\% true positive rate for malicious websites containing exploit URLs at a low false positive rate of 0.1\%. Moreover, it detected 143 more evasive malicious websites than conventional systems.},

However, the importance of binary analysis is on the rise. In many situations binary analysis is the only possible way to prove (or disprove) properties about the code that is actually executed. In this paper, we present a binary analysis framework that implements a number of analysis techniques that have been proposed in the past. We present a systematized implementation of these techniques, which allows other researchers to compose them and develop new approaches. In addition, the implementation of these techniques in a unifying framework allows for the direct comparison of these apporaches and the identification of their advantages and disadvantages. The evaluation included in this paper is performed using a recent dataset created by DARPA for evaluating the effectiveness of binary vulnerability analysis techniques. Our framework has been open-sourced and is available to the security community.},

The increasing popularity of IPFS has attracted large volumes of users and content. Unfortunately, some of this content could be considered ``problematic''. Content moderation is always hard. With a completely decentralized infrastructure and administration, content moderation in IPFS is even more difficult. In this paper, we examine this challenge. We identify, characterize, and measure the presence of problematic content in IPFS (e.g. subject to takedown notices). Our analysis covers 368,762 files. We analyze the complete content moderation process including how these files are flagged, who hosts and retrieves them. We also measure the efficacy of the process. We analyze content submitted to denylist, showing that notable volumes of problematic content are served, and the lack of a centralized approach facilitates its spread. While we identify fast reactions to takedown requests, we also test the resilience of multiple gateways and show that existing means to filter problematic content can be circumvented. We end by proposing improvements to content moderation that result in 227\% increase in the detection of phishing content and reduce the average time to filter such content by 43\%.},

To address this, we conducted real-time analyses on hosts, collecting data on 4,648,939 clickbait PDFs served by 177,835 hosts over 17 months. Our results revealed a diverse infrastructure, with hosts falling into three main hosting types. We also identified at scale the presence of eight software components which facilitate file uploads and which are likely exploited for clickbait PDF distribution. We contact affected parties to report the misuse of their resources via a large-scale vulnerability notification. While we observed some effectiveness in terms of number of cleaned-up PDFs following the notification, long-term improvement in this infrastructure remained insignificant. This finding raises questions about the hosting providers' role in combating abuse and the actual impact of vulnerability notifications.},

Ironically, this well-regarded software engineering practice allows us to build a scalable and precise detector that is able to quickly respond to superficial but frequent changes in EKs. Kizzle is able to generate anti-virus signatures for detecting EKs, which compare favorably to manually created ones. Kizzle is highly responsive and can generate new signatures within hours.

Attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, leveraging new web design patterns to add perceived legitimacy and, at the same time, evade state-of-the-art detectors and web security crawlers.In this paper, we study phishing attacks from a new angle, focusing on how modern phishing websites are designed. Specifically, we aim to better understand what type of user interactions are elicited by phishing websites and how their user experience (UX) and interface (UI) design patterns can help them accomplish two main goals: i) lend a sense of professionalism and legitimacy to the phishing website, and ii) contribute to evading phishing detectors and web security crawlers. To study phishing at scale, we built an intelligent crawler that combines browser automation with machine learning methods to simulate user interactions with phishing pages and explore their UX and UI characteristics. Using our novel methodology, we explore more than 50,000 phishing websites and make the following new observations: i) modern phishing sites often impersonate a brand (e.g., Microsoft Office), but surprisingly, without necessarily cloning or closely mimicking the design of the corresponding legitimate website; ii) they often elicit personal information using a multi-step (or multi-page) process, to mimic users' experience on legitimate sites; iii) they embed modern user verification systems (including CAPTCHAs); and ironically, iv) they sometimes conclude the phishing experience by reassuring the user that their private data was not stolen. We believe our findings can help the community gain a more in-depth understanding of how web-based phishing attacks work from a users' perspective and can be used to inform the development of more accurate and robust phishing detectors.},

  abstract = {Phishing kits allow adversaries with little or no technical experience to launch phishing websites in a short time. Past research has found such phishing kits that contain backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email addresses), which are intentionally added by the kit developers to obtain the phished data. In this work, we augment on prior research by exploring several ways in which security aws in phishing kits make the victim data accessible to a wider set of adversaries beyond the kit deployers and kit developers. We implement an automated framework for kit collection and analysis, which includes a custom command-line PHP execution tool (for dynamic analysis) along with other opensource tools. Our analysis focuses on nding backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email address, command injection), measuring the extent of disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., via exposed plaintext les, hardcoded Telegram bot tokens, hardcoded admin console passwords) and detecting security vulnerabilities in phishing kits. We analyze 4238 distinct phishing kits (from a set of 26,281 compressed les collected from several sources over a span of 15 months), each having unique SHA-1 hash value. We found that 3.9\% of the analyzed kits contained at least one form of backdoor. We also found hardcoded admin console passwords and API keys used to access third party services, in 8.3\% and 16\% of the analyzed kits, respectively. In addition, 15.8\% of the analyzed kits wrote stolen information (PII) of users in plaintext les; 5.6\% kits did not restrict external access to these plaintext les, leading to exposure of sensitive phished data (e.g., 178,504 passwords, 133,248 email addresses, 1253 credit card numbers). Furthermore, 11.7\% of the analyzed kits contained hardcoded Telegram bots; we obtained invite links to join Telegram chats in 0.5\% kits, and found them to expose chat messages containing sensitive PII information of victims (e.g., 73,342 passwords, 141,095 email addresses, 3584 credit card numbers). We also found that 64\% of the kits are affected by security vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure le operations, SQL injection), which can be abused to further expose user data. We have open-sourced our framework and other artifacts to benet future research.},

  abstract = {Today's phishing websites are constantly evolving to deceive users and evade the detection. In this paper, we perform a measurement study on squatting phishing domains where the websites impersonate trusted entities not only at the page content level but also at the web domain level. To search for squatting phishing pages, we scanned five types of squatting domains over 224 million DNS records and identified 657K domains that are likely impersonating 702 popular brands. Then we build a novel machine learning classifier to detect phishing pages from both the web and mobile pages under the squatting domains. A key novelty is that our classifier is built on a careful measurement of evasive behaviors of phishing pages in practice. We introduce new features from visual analysis and optical character recognition (OCR) to overcome the heavy content obfuscation from attackers. In total, we discovered and verified 1,175 squatting phishing pages. We show that these phishing pages are used for various targeted scams, and are highly effective to evade detection. More than 90\% of them successfully evaded popular blacklists for at least a month.},

One of the biggest challenges in the domain of smishing prevention is the availability of fresh smishing datasets. Additionally, as time persists, smishing campaigns are shut down and the crucial information related to the attack are lost. With the changing nature of smishing attacks, a consistent flow of new smishing examples is needed by both researchers and engineers to create effective defenses. In this paper, we present the community-sourced smishing datasets from the smishtank.com. It provides a wealth of information relevant to combating smishing attacks through the breakdown and analysis of smishing samples at the point of submission. In the contribution of our work, we provide a corpus of 1090 smishing samples that have been publicly submitted through the site. Each message includes information relating to the sender, message body, and any brands referenced in the message. Additionally, when a URL is found, we provide additional information on the domain, VirusTotal results, and a characterization of the URL. Through the open access of fresh smishing data, we empower academia and industries to create robust defenses against this evolving threat.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to combat user tracking, both privacy-aware browsers (e.g., Tor) and email applications usually disable JavaScript. This effectively closes a major angle for user fingerprinting. However, recent findings hint at the potential for privacy leakage through selected Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) features. Nevertheless, the full fingerprinting potential of CSS remains unknown, and it is unclear if attacks apply to more restrictive settings such as email. In this paper, we systematically investigate the modern dynamic features of CSS and their applicability for script-less fingerprinting, bypassing many state-of-the-art mitigations. We present three innovative techniques based on fuzzing and templating that exploit nuances in CSS container queries, arithmetic functions, and complex selectors. This allows us to infer detailed application, OS, and hardware configurations at high accuracy. For browsers, we can distinguish 97.95\% of 1176 tested browser-OS combinations. Our methods also apply to email applications - as shown for 8 out of 21 tested web, desktop or mobile email applications. This demonstrates that fingerprinting is possible in the highly restrictive setting of HTML emails and expands the scope of tracking beyond traditional web environments. In response to these and potential future CSS-based tracking capabilities, we propose two defense mechanisms that eliminate the root causes of privacy leakage. For browsers, we propose to preload conditional resources, which eliminates feature-dependent leakage. For the email setting, we design an email proxy service that retains privacy and email integrity while largely preserving feature compatibility. Our work provides new insights and solutions to the ongoing privacy debate, highlighting the importance of robust defenses against emerging tracking methods.},

We implement and analyze Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) attacks, evaluate them and discuss suitable measures for mitigation. To facilitate a thorough analysis, we implement two variants of BitM by using two different technology stacks and compare them to a conventional phishing system based on a proxy. To evaluate BitM attacks, we test our implementations on a number of popular websites. Our results show that in practice BitM attacks are currently highly capable of stealing login information protected by more than one factor, since the difficulty to detect such an attack appears to be greater when using BitM than comparable techniques. Therefore, we propose a new entry for BitM in the Common Attack Patterns Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC). The high effectiveness of the attack technique is limited by mitigation methods such as the use of resistant factors for two-sided authentication. We conclude that BitM attacks can potentially be used for highly effective targeted phishing, but they are unlikely to scale well enough for large-scale phishing attacks aiming at a broad variety of users.},

With the anonymous structure of the internet, attackers attempt to deceive the end-users through different forms namely phishing, malware, SQL injection, man-in-the-middle, domain name system tunnelling, ransomware, web trojan, and so on. Amongst them, phishing is the most deceiving attack, which exploits the vulnerabilities in the end-users. Phishing is often done through emails and malicious websites to lure the user by posing themselves as a trusted entity. Security experts have been proposing many anti-phishing techniques. Till today there is no single solution that is capable of mitigating all the vulnerabilities. A systematic review of current trends in web phishing detection techniques is carried out and a taxonomy of automated web phishing detection is presented. The objective of this study is to acknowledge the status of current research in automated web phishing detection and evaluate their performance.

  abstract = {Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylorseries. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4{\texttimes} increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.

Prior art suggests that automated website cloning, with light mutations, is gaining traction with attackers. This has limited exposure in current literature and leads to sub-optimal ML-based countermeasures. The work herein conducts the first empirical study that compiles and evaluates a variety of state-of-the-art cloning techniques in wide circulation. We collected 13,394 samples and found 8,566 confirmed phishing pages targeting 4 popular websites using 7 distinct cloning mechanisms. These samples were replicated with malicious code removed within a controlled platform fortified with precautions that prevent accidental access. We then reported our sites to VirusTotal and other platforms, with regular polling of results for 7 days, to ascertain the efficacy of each cloning technique. Results show that no security vendor detected our clones, proving the urgent need for more effective detectors. Finally, we posit 4 recommendations to aid web developers and ML-based defences to alleviate the risks of cloning attacks.},

In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art of graph learning. Special attention is paid to four categories of existing graph learning methods, including graph signal processing, matrix factorization, random walk, and deep learning. Major models and algorithms under these categories are reviewed respectively.

The detection of JWMM is challenging due to the complex interoperations and semantic diversity between JavaScript and WebAssembly. To bridge this gap, we present JWBinder, the first technique aimed at enhancing the static detection of JWMM. JWBinder performs a language-specific data-flow analysis to capture the cross-language interoperations and then characterizes the functionalities of JWMM through a unified high-level structure called Inter-language Program Dependency Graph. The extensive evaluation on one of the most representative real-world anti-virus platforms, VirusTotal, shows that JWBinder effectively enhances anti-virus systems from various vendors and increases the overall successful detection rate against JWMM from 49.1\% to 86.2\%. Additionally, we assess the side effects and runtime overhead of JWBinder, corroborating its practical viability in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Recently more and more Android apps integrate the embedded browser, known as ``WebView'', to render web pages and run JavaScript code without leaving these apps. WebView provides a powerful feature that allows event handlers defined in the native context (i.e., Java in Android) to handle web events that occur in WebView. However, as shown in prior work, this feature suffers from remote attacks, which we generalize as EventOriented Exploit (EOE) in this paper, such that adversaries may remotely access local critical functionalities through event handlers in WebView without any permission or authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, EOEDroid, which can automatically vet event handlers in a given hybrid app using selective symbolic execution and static analysis. If a vulnerability is found, EOEDroid also automatically generates exploit code to help developers and analysts verify the vulnerability. To support exploit code generation, we also systematically study web events, event handlers and their trigger constraints. We evaluated our approach on 3,652 most popular apps. The result showed that our approach found 97 total vulnerabilities in 58 apps, including 2 cross-frame DOM manipulation, 53 phishing, 30 sensitive information leakage, 1 local resources access, and 11 Intent abuse vulnerabilities. We also found a potential backdoor in a high profile app that could be used to steal users' sensitive information, such as IMEI. Even though developers attempted to close it, EOEDroid found that adversaries were still able to exploit it by triggering two events together and feeding event handlers with well designed input.},

We show an untrusted web iframe/popup inside WebView becomes dangerous that it can launch these attacks to open holes on existing defense solutions, and obtain risky privileges and abilities, such as breaking web messaging integrity, stealthily accessing sensitive mobile functionalities, and performing phishing attacks. Then, we study and assess the security impacts of DCVs on real-world apps. For this purpose, we develop a novel technique, DCV-Hunter, that can automatically vet Android apps against DCVs. By applying DCV-Hunter on a large number of most popular apps, we find DCVs are prevalent. Many highprofile apps are verified to be impacted, such as Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Google News, Skype, Uber, Yelp, and U.S. Bank.

Unfortunately, ML-PWD are prone to adversarial evasions, evidenced by both academic studies and analyses of real-world adversarial phishing webpages. However, existing works mostly focused on assessing adversarial phishing webpages against ML-PWD, while neglecting a crucial aspect: investigating whether they can deceive the actual target of phishing -- the end users. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting two user studies (n=470) to examine how human users perceive adversarial phishing webpages, spanning both synthetically crafted ones (which we create by evading a state-of-the-art ML-PWD) as well as real adversarial webpages (taken from the wild Web) that bypassed a production-grade ML-PWD. Our findings confirm that adversarial phishing is a threat to both users and ML-PWD, since most adversarial phishing webpages have comparable effectiveness on users w.r.t. unperturbed ones. However, not all adversarial perturbations are equally effective. For example, those with added typos are significantly more noticeable to users, who tend to overlook perturbations of higher visual magnitude (such as replacing the background). We also show that users' self-reported frequency of visiting a brand's website has a statistically negative correlation with their phishing detection accuracy, which is likely caused by overconfidence. We release our resources.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a critical threat to Internet users. Although an extensive ecosystem serves to protect users, phishing websites are growing in sophistication, and they can slip past the ecosystem's detection systems---and subsequently cause realworld damage---with the help of evasion techniques. Sophisticated client-side evasion techniques, known as cloaking, leverage JavaScript to enable complex interactions between potential victims and the phishing website, and can thus be particularly effective in slowing or entirely preventing automated mitigations. Yet, neither the prevalence nor the impact of client-side cloaking has been studied.},

  abstract = {Objective: The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to improve the search step of undertaking SLRs in software engineering (SE) by devising and evaluating systematic and practical approaches to identifying relevant studies in SE. Method: We have systematically selected and analytically studied a large number of papers (SLRs) to understand the state-of-the-practice of search strategies in EBSE. Having identified the limitations of the current ad-hoc nature of search strategies used by SE researchers for SLRs, we have devised a systematic and evidence-based approach to developing and executing optimal search strategies in SLRs. The proposed approach incorporates the concept of `quasi-gold standard' (QGS), which consists of collection of known studies, and corresponding `quasi-sensitivity' into the search process for evaluating search performance. Results: We conducted two participant--observer case studies to demonstrate and evaluate the adoption of the proposed QGS-based systematic search approach in support of SLRs in SE research. Conclusion: We report their findings based on the case studies that the approach is able to improve the rigor of search process in an SLR, as well as it can serve as a supplement to the guidelines for SLRs in EBSE. We plan to further evaluate the proposed approach using a series of case studies on varying research topics in SE.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a ubiquitous and increasingly sophisticated online threat. To evade mitigations, phishers try to "cloak" malicious content from defenders to delay their appearance on blacklists, while still presenting the phishing payload to victims. This cat-and-mouse game is variable and fast-moving, with many distinct cloaking methods---we construct a dataset identifying 2,933 real-world phishing kits that implement cloaking mechanisms. These kits use information from the host, browser, and HTTP request to classify traffic as either anti-phishing entity or potential victim and change their behavior accordingly.In this work we present SPARTACUS, a technique that subverts the phishing status quo by disguising user traffic as anti-phishing entities. These intentional false positives trigger cloaking behavior in phishing kits, thus hiding the malicious payload and protecting the user without disrupting benign sites.To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we deployed SPARTACUS as a browser extension from November 2020 to July 2021. During that time, SPARTACUS browsers visited 160,728 reported phishing URLs in the wild. Of these, SPARTACUS protected against 132,274 sites (82.3\%). The phishing kits which showed malicious content to SPARTACUS typically did so due to ineffective cloaking---the majority (98.4\%) of the remainder were detected by conventional anti-phishing systems such as Google Safe Browsing or VirusTotal, and would be blacklisted regardless. We further evaluate SPARTACUS against benign websites sampled from the Alexa Top One Million List for impacts on latency, accessibility, layout, and CPU overhead, finding minimal performance penalties and no loss in functionality.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a security threat with serious effects on individuals as well as on the targeted brands. Although this threat has been around for quite a long time, it is still very active and successful. In fact, the tactics used by attackers have been evolving continuously in the years to make the attacks more convincing and effective. In this context, phishing detection is of primary importance. The literature offers many diverse solutions that cope with this issue and in particular with the detection of phishing websites. This paper provides a broad and comprehensive review of the state of the art in this field by discussing the main challenges and findings. More specifically, the discussion is centered around three important categories of detection approaches, namely, list-based, similarity-based and machine learning-based. For each category we describe the detection methods proposed in the literature together with the datasets considered for their assessment and we discuss some research gaps that need to be filled.},
