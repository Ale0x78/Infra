Despite numerous previous efforts, similarity-based detection methods do not offer sufficient protection for the trusted websites, in particular against unseen phishing pages. This paper contributes VisualPhishNet, a new similarity-based phishing detection framework, based on a triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). VisualPhishNet learns profiles for websites in order to detect phishing websites by a similarity metric that can generalize to pages with new visual appearances. We furthermore present VisualPhish, the largest dataset to date that facilitates visual phishing detection in an ecologically valid manner. We show that our method outperforms previous visual similarity phishing detection approaches by a large margin while being robust against a range of evasion attacks.},

As a result, most previous works have trained with little or no multi-modal data, which opens several drawbacks. Therefore, this study aims to develop a phishing data repository to meet the diverse data needs of the anti-phishing domain. As a result, a gap-filling solution named PhishRepo was proposed as an online data repository that collects, verifies, disseminates, and archives phishing data. It includes innovative design aspects such as automated submission, deduplication filtering, automated verification, crowdsourcing-based human interaction, an objection reporting window, and target attack prevention techniques. Moreover, the deduplication filter, used for the first time in phishing data collection, significantly impacted the collection process. It eliminated the duplicate data, which causes one of the most common machine learning errors known as data leakage. In addition, PhishRepo enables researchers to apply modern machine learning techniques effectively and supports them by eliminating phishing data hassle. Therefore, more thoughtful use of PhishRepo will lead to effective anti-phishing solutions in the future, minimising the social engineering crime called phishing.},

  abstract = {Ontology matching aims at identifying the correspondences between instances and data properties of different ontologies. The use of data mining approach in matching ontology problem is reviewed in this article. We propose DMOM (Data Mining for Ontology Matching based instances) framework to select data properties of instances efficiently. The framework exploits data mining techniques to select the most appropriate features to match ontologies. Moreover, three strategies have been investigated to select the relevant features for the matching process. The first one called exhaustive, explores the enumerate search tree randomly by generating at each iteration a subset of feature attributes, where each node is evaluated by running the matching process on its selected attributes. The second approach called statistical, it uses some statistical values to select the most relevant properties. The third one called FIM (Frequent Itemsets Mining), it explores the correlation between different properties and selects the most frequent properties describing the overall instances of the given ontology. To demonstrate the usefulness of DMOM framework, several experiments have been carried out on OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) and DBpedia ontology databases. The results show that the third strategy, FIM, outperforms the two other strategies (Exhaustive, and Statistical). The results also reveal that DMOM outperforms the state-of-the-art ontology matching approaches in terms of execution time and the quality of the matching process.},

  abstract = {With more than 500 million daily tweets from over 330 million active users, Twitter constantly attracts malicious users aiming to carry out phishing and malware-related attacks against its user base. It therefore becomes of paramount importance to assess the effectiveness of Twitter's use of blacklists in protecting its users from such threats. We collected more than 182 million public tweets containing URLs from Twitter's Stream API over a 2-month period and compared these URLs against 3 popular phishing, social engineering, and malware blacklists, including Google Safe Browsing (GSB). We focus on the delay period between an attack URL first being tweeted to appearing on a blacklist, as this is the timeframe in which blacklists do not warn users, leaving them vulnerable. Experiments show that, whilst GSB is effective at blocking a number of social engineering and malicious URLs within 6 hours of being tweeted, a significant number of URLs go undetected for at least 20 days. For instance, during one month, we discovered 4,930 tweets containing URLs leading to social engineering websites that had been tweeted to over 131 million Twitter users. We also discovered 1,126 tweets containing 376 blacklisted Bitly URLs that had a combined total of 991,012 clicks, posing serious security and privacy threats. In addition, an equally large number of URLs contained within public tweets remain in GSB for at least 150 days, raising questions about potential false positives in the blacklist. We also provide evidence to suggest that Twitter may no longer be using GSB to protect its users.},

By collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing DNS records, TLS certificates, phishing URLs, phishing website source code, phishing emails, web traffic to phishing websites, news articles, and government announcements, we track trends of phishing activity between January and May 2020 and seek to understand the key implications of the underlying trends.We find that phishing attack traffic in March and April 2020 skyrocketed up to 220\% of its pre-COVID-19 rate, far exceeding typical seasonal spikes. Attackers exploited victims' uncertainty and fear related to the pandemic through a variety of highly targeted scams, including emerging scam types against which current defenses are not sufficient as well as traditional phishing which outpaced the ecosystem's collective response.},

However, the public still sees software development as a profession for "math wizards". To learn more about this special type of knowledge worker from their first-person perspective, we conducted three studies to learn how developers describe a day in their life through vlogs on YouTube and how these vlogs were received by the broader community. We first interviewed 16 developers who vlogged to identify their motivations for creating this content and their intention behind what they chose to portray. Second, we analyzed 130 vlogs (video blogs) to understand the range of the content conveyed through videos. Third, we analyzed 1176 comments from the 130 vlogs to understand the impact the vlogs have on the audience. We found that developers were motivated to promote and build a diverse community, by sharing different aspects of life that define their identity, and by creating awareness about learning and career opportunities in computing. They used vlogs to share a variety of how software developers work and live---showcasing often unseen experiences, including intimate moments from their personal life. From our comment analysis, we found that the vlogs were valuable to the audience to find information and seek advice. Commenters sought opportunities to connect with others over shared triumphs and trials they faced that were also shown in the vlogs. As a central theme, we found that developers use vlogs to challenge the misconceptions and stereotypes around their identity, work-life, and well-being. These social stigmas are obstacles to an inclusive and accepting community and can deter people from choosing software development as a career. We also discuss the implications of using vlogs to support developers, researchers, and beyond.},

  abstract = {Size, accessibility, and rate of growth of Online Social Media (OSM) has attracted cyber crimes through them. One form of cyber crime that has been increasing steadily is phishing, where the goal (for the phishers) is to steal personal information from users which can be used for fraudulent purposes. Although the research community and industry has been developing techniques to identify phishing attacks through emails and instant messaging (IM), there is very little research done, that provides a deeper understanding of phishing in online social media. Due to constraints of limited text space in social systems like Twitter, phishers have begun to use URL shortener services. In this study, we provide an overview of phishing attacks for this new scenario. One of our main conclusions is that phishers are using URL shorteners not only for reducing space but also to hide their identity. We observe that social media websites like Facebook, Habbo, Orkut are competing with e-commerce services like PayPal, eBay in terms of traffic and focus of phishers. Orkut, Habbo, and Facebook are amongst the top 5 brands targeted by phishers. We study the referrals from Twitter to understand the evolving phishing strategy. A staggering 89\% of references from Twitter (users) are inorganic accounts which are sparsely connected amongst themselves, but have large number of followers and followees. We observe that most of the phishing tweets spread by extensive use of attractive words and multiple hashtags. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to connect the phishing landscape using blacklisted phishing URLs from PhishTank, URL statistics from bit.ly and cues from Twitter to track the impact of phishing in online social media.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a form of identity theft in which an attacker attempts to elicit confidential information from unsuspecting victims. While in the past there has been significant work on defending from phishing, much less is known about the tools and techniques used by attackers, i.e., phishers. Of particular importance to understanding the phishers’ methods and motivations are phishing kits, packages that contain complete phishing web sites in an easy-to-deploy format. In this paper, we study in detail the kits distributed for free in underground circles and those obtained by crawling live phishing sites. We notice that phishing kits often contain backdoors that send the entered information to third parties. We conclude that phishing kits target two classes of victims: the gullible users from whom they extort valuable information and the unexperienced phishers who deploy them.},

  abstract = {The so-called “phishing” attacks are one of the important threats to individuals and corporations in today’s Internet. Combatting phishing is thus a top-priority, and has been the focus of much work, both on the academic and on the industry sides. In this paper, we look at this problem from a new angle. We have monitored a total of 19,066 phishing attacks over a period of ten months and found that over 90\% of these attacks were actually replicas or variations of other attacks in the database. This provides several opportunities and insights for the fight against phishing: first, quickly and efficiently detecting replicas is a very effective prevention tool. We detail one such tool in this paper. Second, the widely held belief that phishing attacks are dealt with promptly is but an illusion. We have recorded numerous attacks that stay active throughout our observation period. This shows that the current prevention techniques are ineffective and need to be overhauled. We provide some suggestions in this direction. Third, our observation give a new perspective into the modus operandi of attackers. In particular, some of our observations suggest that a small group of attackers could be behind a large part of the current attacks. Taking down that group could potentially have a large impact on the phishing attacks observed today.},

  abstract = {Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs), has resulted in powerful and versatile dual-use systems. This intelligence can be put towards a wide variety of beneficial tasks, yet it can also be used to cause harm. This study explores one such harm by examining how LLMs can be used for spear phishing, a form of cybercrime that involves manipulating targets into divulging sensitive information. I first explore LLMs’ ability to assist with the reconnaissance and message generation stages of a spear phishing attack, where I find that LLMs are capable of assisting with the email generation phase of a spear phishing attack. To explore how LLMs could potentially be harnessed to scale spear phishing campaigns, I then create unique spear phishing messages for over 600 British Members of Parliament using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. My findings provide some evidence that these messages are not only realistic but also cost-effective, with each email costing only a fraction of a cent to generate. Next, I demonstrate how basic prompt engineering can circumvent safeguards installed in LLMs, highlighting the need for further research into robust interventions that can help prevent models from being misused. To further address these evolving risks, I explore two potential solutions: structured access schemes, such as application programming interfaces, and LLM-based defensive systems.},

We develop a classifier that finds hundreds of real-world lateral phishing emails, while generating under four false positives per every one-million employeesent emails. Drawing on the attacks we detect, as well as a corpus of user-reported incidents, we quantify the scale of lateral phishing, identify several thematic content and recipient targeting strategies that attackers follow, illuminate two types of sophisticated behaviors that attackers exhibit, and estimate the success rate of these attacks.

  abstract = {Websites unfortunately play a powerful role in delivering malicious content to users during cyberattacks. In particular, the threat of phishing websites that tricks users by abusing their corporate and brand names is increasing. Building a website requires infrastructure costs (e.g., domain name fees) and operational costs (e.g., managing server settings). Additionally, many companies spend considerable resources managing their own IT assets and security countermeasures. Even when phishing websites are taken down, attackers persist by scrapping and rebuilding them, as doing so is inexpensive. Notably, there are significant differences in website building costs between companies and attackers. In this study, we propose a method of analyzing the costs incurred in a process of building websites from domain name registration to website deployment to detect phishing websites. We evaluate our method using data from 1,082 large corporate websites and 1,163 phishing websites. As a result, our method achieves a detection performance of 95\% precision and 96\% recall. In addition, we show that our method still achieves a 95\% recall for 866 phishing websites even after six months and the indicator of website building costs is robust to concept drift. We further discuss the applicability of the cost indicator.},

  abstract = {Malicious websites are considered one of the top threats to the modern Internet. Thus, it is critical to effectively detect malicious websites for the security of the Internet. Conventional technologies typically rely on URL blacklists, or static and dynamic code analysis, which are known to have limitations. In order to effectively detect malicious websites, in this paper, we study malicious websites from the perspective of system provenance analysis for the first time. We first conduct a systematic feature engineering study on thousands of benign and malicious websites from the perspective of system provenance data. In our study, we discover eight useful features for malicious website detection. Based on these eight features, we propose ProvWeb, a novel non-intrusive system provenance-based tool, for malicious website detection. In our evaluation, ProvWeb can achieve an F1 score of 93.7\% ∼ 99.7\% for the four combinations of browsers and OSes (Windows Chrome, Windows Firefox, Linux Chrome, Linux Firefox). This result confirms that the features discovered in provenance graphs are effective in detecting malicious websites.},

Many cyber attacks are spread via mechanisms that exploit weaknesses found in endusers, which makes users the weakest element in the security chain. The phishing problem is broad and no single silver-bullet solution exists to mitigate all the vulnerabilities effectively, thus multiple techniques are often implemented to mitigate specific attacks. This paper aims at surveying many of the recently proposed phishing mitigation techniques. A high-level overview of various categories of phishing mitigation techniques is also presented, such as: detection, offensive defense, correction, and prevention, which we belief is critical to present where the phishing detection techniques fit in the overall mitigation process.},

Man-in-theMiddle (MITM) phishing toolkits are the latest evolution in this space, where toolkits act as malicious reverse proxy servers of online services, mirroring live content to users while extracting credentials and session cookies in transit. These tools further reduce the work required by attackers, automate the harvesting of 2FAauthenticated sessions, and substantially increase the believability of phishing web pages. In this paper, we present the first analysis of MITM phishing toolkits used in the wild. By analyzing and experimenting with these toolkits, we identify intrinsic network-level properties that can be used to identify them. Based on these properties, we develop a machine learning classifier that identifies the presence of such toolkits in online communications with 99.9\% accuracy.},

In particular, logo-based phishing detectors rely on DL models from Computer Vision to identify logos of well-known brands on webpages, to detect malicious webpages that imitate a given brand. For instance, Siamese networks have demonstrated notable performance for these tasks, enabling the corresponding antiphishing solutions to detect even “zero-day” phishing webpages. In this work, we take the next step of studying the robustness of logo-based phishing detectors against adversarial ML attacks. We propose a novel attack leveraging generative adversarial perturbations to craft “adversarial logos” that, with no knowledge of phishing detection models, can successfully evade the detectors. We evaluate our attacks through: (i) experiments on datasets containing real logos, to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art phishing detectors; and (ii) user studies to gauge whether our adversarial logos can deceive human eyes. The results show that our proposed attack is capable of crafting perturbed logos subtle enough to evade various DL models—achieving an evasion rate of up to 95\%. Moreover, users are not able to spot significant differences between generated adversarial logos and original ones.},

  author = {Liu, Ruofan and Lin, Yun and Yang, Xianglin and Ng, Siang Hwee},
  abstract = {Explainable phishing detection approaches are usually based on references, i.e., they compare a suspicious webpage against a reference list of commonly targeted legitimate brands’ webpages. If a webpage is detected as similar to any referenced website but their domains are not aligned, a phishing alert is raised with an explanation comprising its targeted brand. In comparison to other techniques, such explainable reference-based solutions are more robust to ever-changing phishing webpages. However, the webpage similarity is still measured by representations conveying only partial intentions (e.g., screenshot and logo), which (i) incurs considerable false positives and (ii) gives an adversary opportunities to compromise user confidence in the approaches. In this work, we propose, PhishIntention, to extract precise phishing intention of a webpage by visually (i) extracting its brand intention and credential-taking intention, and (ii) interacting with the webpage to confirm the credential-taking intention. We design PhishIntention as a heterogeneous system of deep learning vision models, overcoming various technical challenges. The models “look at” and “interact with” the webpage for its intention, which are robust to potential HTML obfuscation. We compare PhishIntention with four state-ofthe-art reference-based approaches on the largest phishing identification dataset consisting of 50K phishing and benign webpages. For similar level of recall, PhishIntention achieves significantly higher precision than the baselines. Moreover, we conduct a continuous field study on the Internet for two months to discover emerging phishing webpages. PhishIntention detects 1,942 new phishing webpages (1,368 not reported by VirusTotal). Comparing to the best baseline, PhishIntention generates 86.5\% less false alerts (139 vs. 1,033 false positives) while detecting similar number of real phishing webpages. Our models and code are available at https: //github.com/lindsey98/PhishIntention.git.},

We thus refer to this type of e-learning practices in which people perform learning-related tasks with open calls in an online community to gain knowledge or skills in specific areas as crowdsourced learning (CL). To understand this emerging phenomenon in GitHub, we investigate the popularity of the learning projects and learners’ CL activities, first on the extracted GHTorrent learning projects and then on a selected sample of 105 popular learning projects. We then conduct an online survey of 301 learners to qualitatively understand their practices and perceptions of CL in GitHub. Our main findings reveal that the learners’ CL practices show some different characteristics from those of open source development, e.g., the learning projects have very few long-term contributors (less than 5\% of all contributors). Moreover, although the learners benefit from conducting personalized learning with the high-quality content and contributions made by the community, they encounter challenges in maintaining initiatives to conduct continuous unsupervised learning and in ensuring the quality of content and contributions. Based on the findings, we discuss the reasons behind the growth of CL and provide implications on the CL platform design.},

First, we demonstrate the employment of ChatGPT to understand and annotate the content published in software repositories. Second, we provide evidence of hidden risk in educational repositories contributing to the opportunities of potential threats and malicious intents. We carry out a systematic study on a collection of 35.2K GitHub repositories claimed to be created for educational purposes only. First, our study finds an increasing trend in the number of such repositories published every year. Second, 9294 of them are labeled by ChatGPT as malicious, and further categorization of the malicious ones detects 14 different malware families including DDoS, keylogger, ransomware and so on. Overall, this exploratory study flags a wake-up call for the community for better understanding and analysis of software platforms.},

This paper explores speculative side-channel attacks and their implications for programming languages. These attacks leak information through micro-architectural side-channels which we show are not mere bugs, but in fact lie at the foundation of optimization. We identify three open problems, (1) finding side-channels, (2) understanding speculative vulnerabilities, and (3) mitigating them. For (1) we introduce a mathematical meta-model that clarifies the source of side-channels in simulations and CPUs. For (2) we introduce an architectural model with speculative semantics to study recently-discovered vulnerabilities. For (3) we explore and evaluate software mitigations and prove one correct for this model. Our analysis is informed by extensive offensive research and defensive implementation work for V8, the production JavaScript virtual machine in Chrome. Straightforward extensions to model real hardware suggest these vulnerabilities present formidable challenges for effective, efficient mitigation. As a result of our work, we now believe that speculative vulnerabilities on today’s hardware defeat all language-enforced confidentiality with no known comprehensive software mitigations, as we have discovered that untrusted code can construct a universal read gadget to read all memory in the same address space through side-channels. In the face of this reality, we have shifted the security model of the Chrome web browser and V8 to process isolation.},

  abstract = {Attackers (“phishers”) typically deploy source code in some host website to impersonate a brand or in general a situation in which a user is expected to provide some personal information of interest to phishers (e.g. credentials, credit card number). Phishing kits are ready-to-deploy sets of files that can be simply copied on a web server and used almost as they are. In this paper, we consider the static similarity analysis of the source code of 20 871 phishing kits totalling over 182 million lines of PHP, Javascript and HTML code, that have been collected during phishing attacks and recovered by forensics teams. Reported experimental results show that as much as 90\% of the analyzed kits share 90\% or more of their source code with at least another kit. Differences are small, less than about 1000 programming words – identifiers, constants, strings and so on – in 40\% of cases. A plausible lineage of phishing kits is presented by connecting together kits with the highest similarity. Obtained results show a very different reconstructed lineage for phishing kits when compared to a publicly available application such as Wordpress. Observed kits similarity distribution is consistent with the assumed hypothesis that kit propagation is often based on identical or near-identical copies at low cost changes. The proposed approach may help classifying new incoming phishing kits as ”near-copy” or ”intellectual leaps” from known and already encountered kits. This could facilitate the identification and classification of new kits as derived from older known kits.},

Based on this technology, a new form of parasitic computing, widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining, has gained momentum in the web. A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. For this, we propose a 3-phase analysis approach, which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites. We find that cryptojacking is common, with currently 1 out of 500 sites hosting a mining script. Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape, including a measurement of code characteristics, an estimate of expected mining revenue, and an evaluation of current blacklist-based countermeasures.},

The first thing we need to do to combat the ever-increasing number of phishing attacks is to collect and characterize more phishing cases that reach end users. Without understanding these characteristics, anti-phishing countermeasures cannot evolve. In this study, we propose an approach using Twitter as a new observation point to immediately collect and characterize phishing cases via e-mail and SMS that evade countermeasures and reach users. Specifically, we propose CrowdCanary, a system capable of structurally and accurately extracting phishing information (e.g., URLs and domains) from tweets about phishing by users who have actually discovered or encountered it. In our three months of live operation, CrowdCanary identified 35,432 phishing URLs out of 38,935 phishing reports, 31,960 (90.2\%) of these phishing URLs were later detected by the anti-virus engine.

  abstract = {Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent: 2016 saw more phishing attacks than any previous year on record according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group. At the same time, the growing level of sophistication of cybercriminals must be understood for the development of effective anti-phishing systems, as phishers have extensive control over the content they serve to their victims. By examining two large, real-world datasets of phishing kits and URLs from 2016 through mid2017, we paint a clear picture of today’s anti-phishing ecosystem while inferring the higher-level motives and thought processes of phishers. We analyze the nature of server-side .htaccess filtering techniques used by phishers to evade detection by the security community. We also propose a new generic classification scheme for phishing URLs which corresponds to modern social engineering techniques and reveals a correlation between URL type and compromised infrastructure use. Our analysis identifies measures that can be taken by the security community to defeat phishers’ countermeasures and increase the likelihood of a timely response to phishing. We discover that phishers have a keen awareness of the infrastructure used against them, which illustrates the ever-evolving struggle between cybercriminals and security researchers and motivates future work to positively impact online security.},

  abstract = {Phishing attacks have reached record volumes in recent years. Simultaneously, modern phishing websites are growing in sophistication by employing diverse cloaking techniques to avoid detection by security infrastructure. In this paper, we present PhishFarm: a scalable framework for methodically testing the resilience of anti-phishing entities and browser blacklists to attackers’ evasion efforts. We use PhishFarm to deploy 2,380 live phishing sites (on new, unique, and previously-unseen .com domains) each using one of six different HTTP request filters based on real phishing kits. We reported subsets of these sites to 10 distinct anti-phishing entities and measured both the occurrence and timeliness of native blacklisting in major web browsers to gauge the effectiveness of protection ultimately extended to victim users and organizations. Our experiments revealed shortcomings in current infrastructure, which allows some phishing sites to go unnoticed by the security community while remaining accessible to victims. We found that simple cloaking techniques representative of real-world attacks— including those based on geolocation, device type, or JavaScript—were effective in reducing the likelihood of blacklisting by over 55\% on average. We also discovered that blacklisting did not function as intended in popular mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox), which left users of these browsers particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks. Following disclosure of our findings, anti-phishing entities are now better able to detect and mitigate several cloaking techniques (including those that target mobile users), and blacklisting has also become more consistent between desktop and mobile platforms— but work remains to be done by anti-phishing entities to ensure users are adequately protected. Our PhishFarm framework is designed for continuous monitoring of the ecosystem and can be extended to test future state-of-the-art evasion techniques used by malicious websites.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is crucial to the advancement of science; it strengthens confidence in seemingly contradictory results and expands the boundaries of known discoveries. Computer Security has the natural benefit of creating artifacts that should facilitate computational reproducibility, the ability for others to use someone else’s code and data to independently recreate results, in a relatively straightforward fashion. While the Security community has recently increased its attention on reproducibility, an independent and comprehensive measurement of the current state of reproducibility has not been conducted. In this paper, we perform the first such study, targeting reproducible artifacts generated specifically by papers on machine learning security (one of the most popular areas in academic research) published in Tier 1 security conferences over the past ten years (2013-2022). We perform our measurement study of indirect and direct reproducibility over nearly 750 papers, their codebases, and datasets. Our analysis shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the availability of artifacts before and after the introduction of Artifact Evaluation Committees in Tier 1 conferences. However, based on three years of results, artifacts that pass through this process work at a higher rate than those that do not. From our collected findings, we offer data-driven suggestions for improving reproducibility in our community, including five common problems observed in our study. In so doing, we demonstrate that significant progress still needs to be made in computational reproducibility in Computer Security research.},

Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a large-scale measurement and a systematic analysis to reveal the attack surfaces of the CI/CD pipeline and quantify their security impacts. Specifically, for the measurement, we collect a data set of 320,000+ CI/CD pipeline-configured GitHub repositories and build an analysis tool to parse the CI/CD pipelines and extract security-critical usages. Our measurement reveals that the script runtimes are prone to code hiding while the script usage update is not in time, giving attackers chances to hide malicious code and exploit existing vulnerabilities. Moreover, even the scripts from verified creators may contain severe vulnerabilities. Besides current CI/CD ecosystem heavily relies on several core scripts, which may lead to a single point of failure. While the CI/CD pipelines contain sensitive information/operations, making them the attacker’s favorite targets.},

  abstract = {Phishing is one of the most dangerous threats in which a hacker imitates a person, company or government agency to lure and deceive their victims. Machine learning anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity nowadays. However, most anti-phishing solutions rely heavily on features extracted from third-party services such as whois services, DNS search, and web traffic. As a result, they are slow and require a lot of computing resources. This paper introduces a machine-learning-based framework: Phish-Sight that detects phishing websites through a visual inspection strategy. Phish-Sight uses dominant color features and highly targeted popular brand names embedded in URLs’ web pages with machine learning techniques to detect phishing web pages. Prediction performance of the dominant color features and popular brand names from web pages was investigated using five machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm surpassed the others, with a 98.43\% true positive rate and 99.13\% accuracy in detecting phishing frauds. The prediction run time per web page measured at 7.6~s suggests that Phish-Sight has potential for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing phishing campaigns around the globe have been one of the main threats to cyber security. In response, the global anti-phishing entity (e.g., APWG) collectively maintains the up-to-date blacklist database (e.g., eCrimeX) against phishing campaigns, and so do modern browsers (e.g., Google Safe Browsing). However, our finding reveals that such a mutual assistance system has remained a blind spot when detecting geolocation-based phishing campaigns. In this paper, we focus on phishing campaigns against the web portal service with the largest number of users (42 million) in South Korea. We harvest 1,558 phishing URLs from varying resources in the span of a full year, of which only a small fraction (3.8\%) have been detected by eCrimeX despite a wide spectrum of active fraudulence cases. We demystify three pervasive types of phishing campaigns in South Korea: i) sophisticated phishing campaigns with varying adversarial tactics such as a proxy configuration, ii) phishing campaigns against a second-hand online market, and iii) phishing campaigns against a non-specific target. Aligned with previous findings, a phishing kit that supports automating the whole phishing campaign is prevalent. Besides, we frequently observe a hit-andrun scam where a phishing campaign is immediately inaccessible right after victimization is complete, each of which is tailored to a single potential victim over a new channel like a messenger. As part of mitigation efforts, we promptly provide regional phishing information to APWG, and immediately lock down a victim’s account to prevent further damages.},

We perform a series of measurements by setting up our own phishing websites (mimicking PayPal and IRS) and submitting the URLs for scanning. By analyzing the incoming network traffic and the dynamic label changes at VirusTotal, we reveal new insights into how VirusTotal works and the quality of their labels. Among other things, we show that vendors have trouble flagging all phishing sites, and even the best vendors missed 30\% of our phishing sites. In addition, the scanning results are not immediately updated to VirusTotal after the scanning, and there are inconsistent results between VirusTotal scan and some vendors’ own scanners. Our results reveal the need for developing more rigorous methodologies to assess and make use of the labels obtained from VirusTotal.},

Recent techniques use search engine based approach to counter the phishing attacks as it achieves promising detection accuracy. But, the limitation of this approach is that it fails when phishing page is hosted on compromised server. Moreover, it also results in low true negative rate when newly registered or non-popular domains are encountered. Hence, in this paper, we propose an application named as Jail-Phish, which improves the accuracy of the search engine based techniques with an ability to detect the Phishing Sites Hosted on Compromised Servers (PSHCS) and also detection of newly registered legitimate sites. Jail-Phish compares the suspicious site and matched domain in the search results for calculating the similarity score between them. There exists some degree of similarity such as logos, favicons, images, scripts, styles, and anchorlinks within the pages of the same website whereas on the other side, the dissimilarity within the pages is very high in PSHCS. Hence, we use the similarity score between the suspicious site and matched domain as a parameter to detect the PSHCS. From the experimental results, it is observed that Jail-Phish achieved an accuracy of 98.61\%, true positive rate of 97.77\% and false positive rate less than 0.64\%.},

  abstract = {Current production web browsers are multi-process but place different web sites in the same renderer process, which is not sufficient to mitigate threats present on the web today. With the prevalence of private user data stored on web sites, the risk posed by compromised renderer processes, and the advent of transient execution attacks like Spectre and Meltdown that can leak data via microarchitectural state, it is no longer safe to render documents from different web sites in the same process. In this paper, we describe our successful deployment of the Site Isolation architecture to all desktop users of Google Chrome as a mitigation for process-wide attacks. Site Isolation locks each renderer process to documents from a single site and filters certain cross-site data from each process. We overcame performance and compatibility challenges to adapt a production browser to this new architecture. We find that this architecture offers the best path to protection against compromised renderer processes and same-process transient execution attacks, despite current limitations. Our performance results indicate it is practical to deploy this level of isolation while sufficiently preserving compatibility with existing web content. Finally, we discuss future directions and how the current limitations of Site Isolation might be addressed.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being applied to malicious JavaScript detection in response to the growing number of Web attacks and the attendant costly manual identification. In practice, to hide their malicious behaviors or protect intellectual copyrights, both malicious and benign scripts tend to obfuscate their own code before uploading. While obfuscation is beneficial, it also introduces some additional code features (e.g., dead code) into the code. When machine learning is employed to learn a malicious JavaScript detector, these additional features can affect the model to make it less effective. However, there is still a lack of clear understanding of how robust existing machine learning-based detectors are on different obfuscators. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to figure out how obfuscation affects machine learning detectors based on static features. Through the results, we observe several findings: 1) Obfuscation has a significant impact on the effectiveness of detectors, causing an increase both in false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR), and the bias of obfuscation in the training set induces detectors to detect obfuscation rather than malicious behaviors. 2) The common measures such as improving the quality of the training set by adding relevant obfuscated samples and leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models can not work well.3) The root cause of obfuscation effects on these detectors is that feature spaces they use can only reflect shallow differences in code, not about the nature of benign and malicious, which can be easily affected by the differences brought by obfuscation. 4) Obfuscation has a similar effect on realistic detectors in VirusTotal, indicating that this is a common real-world problem.},

  abstract = {Free Website Building services (FWBs) provide individuals with a cost-effective and convenient way to create a website without requiring advanced technical knowledge or coding skills. However, malicious actors often abuse these services to host phishing websites. In this work, we propose FreePhish, a scalable framework to continuously identify phishing websites that are created using FWBs. Using FreePhish, we were able to detect and characterize more than 31.4K phishing URLs that were created using 17 unique free website builder services and shared on Twitter and Facebook over a period of six months. We find that FWBs provide attackers with several features that make it easier to create and maintain phishing websites at scale while simultaneously evading anti-phishing countermeasures. Our study indicates that antiphishing blocklists and browser protection tools have significantly lower coverage and high detection time against FWB phishing attacks when compared to regular (self-hosted) phishing websites. While our prompt disclosure of these attacks helped some FWBs to remove these attacks, we found several others who were slow at removal or did not remove them outright, with the same also being true for Twitter and Facebook. Finally, we also provide FreePhish as a free Chromium web extension that can be utilized to prevent end-users from accessing potential FWB-based phishing attacks.},

  abstract = {With the recent rise of HTTPS adoption on the Web, attackers have begun “HTTPSifying” phishing websites. HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. Furthermore, we developed a real-time monitoring system using the analysis techniques. We demonstrate its usefulness for the practical security operation. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs.},

  abstract = {The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.1 Disclaimer. This paper contains examples of harmful language.

  abstract = {Phishing kits allow adversaries with little or no technical experience to launch phishing websites in a short time. Past research has found such phishing kits that contain backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email addresses), which are intentionally added by the kit developers to obtain the phished data. In this work, we augment on prior research by exploring several ways in which security aws in phishing kits make the victim data accessible to a wider set of adversaries beyond the kit deployers and kit developers. We implement an automated framework for kit collection and analysis, which includes a custom command-line PHP execution tool (for dynamic analysis) along with other opensource tools. Our analysis focuses on nding backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email address, command injection), measuring the extent of disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., via exposed plaintext les, hardcoded Telegram bot tokens, hardcoded admin console passwords) and detecting security vulnerabilities in phishing kits. We analyze 4238 distinct phishing kits (from a set of 26,281 compressed les collected from several sources over a span of 15 months), each having unique SHA-1 hash value. We found that 3.9\% of the analyzed kits contained at least one form of backdoor. We also found hardcoded admin console passwords and API keys used to access third party services, in 8.3\% and 16\% of the analyzed kits, respectively. In addition, 15.8\% of the analyzed kits wrote stolen information (PII) of users in plaintext les; 5.6\% kits did not restrict external access to these plaintext les, leading to exposure of sensitive phished data (e.g., 178,504 passwords, 133,248 email addresses, 1253 credit card numbers). Furthermore, 11.7\% of the analyzed kits contained hardcoded Telegram bots; we obtained invite links to join Telegram chats in 0.5\% kits, and found them to expose chat messages containing sensitive PII information of victims (e.g., 73,342 passwords, 141,095 email addresses, 3584 credit card numbers). We also found that 64\% of the kits are affected by security vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure le operations, SQL injection), which can be abused to further expose user data.

To search for squatting phishing pages, we scanned five types of squatting domains over 224 million DNS records and identified 657K domains that are likely impersonating 702 popular brands. Then we build a novel machine learning classifier to detect phishing pages from both the web and mobile pages under the squatting domains. A key novelty is that our classifier is built on a careful measurement of evasive behaviors of phishing pages in practice. We introduce new features from visual analysis and optical character recognition (OCR) to overcome the heavy content obfuscation from attackers. In total, we discovered and verified 1,175 squatting phishing pages. We show that these phishing pages are used for various targeted scams, and are highly effective to evade detection. More than 90\% of them successfully evaded popular blacklists for at least a month.},

However, existing anti-virus solutions based on static program analysis are still limited to monolingual code. As a result, their detection effectiveness decreases significantly against JWMM. The detection of JWMM is challenging due to the complex interoperations and semantic diversity between JavaScript and WebAssembly. To bridge this gap, we present JWBinder, the first technique aimed at enhancing the static detection of JWMM. JWBinder performs a language-specific data-flow analysis to capture the cross-language interoperations and then characterizes the functionalities of JWMM through a unified high-level structure called Inter-language Program Dependency Graph. The extensive evaluation on one of the most representative real-world anti-virus platforms, VirusTotal, shows that JWBinder effectively enhances anti-virus systems from various vendors and increases the overall successful detection rate against JWMM from 49.1\% to 86.2\%. Additionally, we assess the side effects and runtime overhead of JWBinder, corroborating its practical viability in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Objective: The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to improve the search step of undertaking SLRs in software engineering (SE) by devising and evaluating systematic and practical approaches to identifying relevant studies in SE. Method: We have systematically selected and analytically studied a large number of papers (SLRs) to understand the state-of-the-practice of search strategies in EBSE. Having identified the limitations of the current ad-hoc nature of search strategies used by SE researchers for SLRs, we have devised a systematic and evidence-based approach to developing and executing optimal search strategies in SLRs. The proposed approach incorporates the concept of ‘quasi-gold standard’ (QGS), which consists of collection of known studies, and corresponding ‘quasi-sensitivity’ into the search process for evaluating search performance. Results: We conducted two participant–observer case studies to demonstrate and evaluate the adoption of the proposed QGS-based systematic search approach in support of SLRs in SE research. Conclusion: We report their findings based on the case studies that the approach is able to improve the rigor of search process in an SLR, as well as it can serve as a supplement to the guidelines for SLRs in EBSE. We plan to further evaluate the proposed approach using a series of case studies on varying research topics in SE.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a ubiquitous and increasingly sophisticated online threat. To evade mitigations, phishers try to “cloak” malicious content from defenders to delay their appearance on blacklists, while still presenting the phishing payload to victims. This catand-mouse game is variable and fast-moving, with many distinct cloaking methods—we construct a dataset identifying 2,933 realworld phishing kits that implement cloaking mechanisms. These kits use information from the host, browser, and HTTP request to classify traffic as either anti-phishing entity or potential victim and change their behavior accordingly.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a security threat with serious effects on individuals as well as on the targeted brands. Although this threat has been around for quite a long time, it is still very active and successful. In fact, the tactics used by attackers have been evolving continuously in the years to make the attacks more convincing and effective. In this context, phishing detection is of primary importance. The literature offers many diverse solutions that cope with this issue and in particular with the detection of phishing websites. This paper provides a broad and comprehensive review of the state of the art in this field by discussing the main challenges and findings. More specifically, the discussion is centered around three important categories of detection approaches, namely, list-based, similarity-based and machine learning-based. For each category we describe the detection methods proposed in the literature together with the datasets considered for their assessment and we discuss some research gaps that need to be filled.},
